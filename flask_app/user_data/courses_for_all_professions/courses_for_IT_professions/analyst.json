Our language of choice, Python, is an easy-to learn, high-level computer language that is used in many of the computational courses offered on Coursera. To make learning Python easy, we have developed a new browser-based programming environment that makes developing interactive applications in Python simple. These applications will involve windows whose contents are graphical and respond to buttons, the keyboard and the mouse.\n\nIn part 2 of this course, we will introduce more elements of programming (such as list, dictionaries, and loops) and then use these elements to create games such as Blackjack.  Part 1 of this class will culminate in building a version of the classic arcade game \"Asteroids\".  Upon completing this course, you will be able to write small, but interesting Python programs.  The next course in the specialization will begin to introduce a more principled approach to writing programs and solving computational problems that will allow you to write larger and more complex programs.",

Logistic Regression is an important fundamental concept if you want break into Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Even though popular machine learning frameworks have implementations of logistic regression available, it's still a great idea to learn to implement it on your own to understand the mechanics of optimization algorithm, and the training and validation process.\n\nSince this is a practical, project-based course, you will need to have a theoretical understanding of logistic regression, and gradient descent. We will focus on the practical aspect of implementing logistic regression with gradient descent, but not on the theoretical aspect.\n\nBy the end of this course, you would create and train a logistic model that will be able to predict if a given image is of hand-written digit zero or of hand-written digit one. The model will be able to distinguish between images or 0s and 1s, and it will do that with a very high accuracy. Not only that, your implementation of the logistic model will also be able to solve any generic binary classiﬁcation problem. You will still have to train model instances on speciﬁc datasets of course, but you won’t have to change the implementation and it will be re-usable. The dataset for images of hand written digits comes from the popular MNIST dataset. This data set consists of images for the 10 hand-written digits (from 0 to 9), but since we are implementing logistic regression, and are looking to solve binary classiﬁcation problems - we will work with examples of hand written zeros, and hand written ones and we will ignore examples of rest of the digits.\n\nThis course runs on Coursera's hands-on project platform called Rhyme. On Rhyme, you do projects in a hands-on manner in your browser. You will get instant access to pre-configured cloud desktops containing all of the software and data you need for the project. Everything is already set up directly in your internet browser so you can just focus on learning. For this project, you’ll get instant access to a cloud desktop with Python, Jupyter, and Tensorflow pre-installed.\n\nNotes:\n-  You will be able to access the cloud desktop 5 times. However, you will be able to access instructions videos as many times as you want.\n- This course works best for learners who are based in the North America region.

The Python programming language and video games are used to demonstrate computer science concepts in a concrete and fun manner.  However, a learner can take the knowledge and skills from this course and apply them to non-game problems, other programming languages, and other computer science courses.\n\nYou do not need any previous programming, Python, or video game experience.  However, some computer skills (e.g., mouse, keyboard, document editing), knowledge of algebra, attention to detail (as with many technical subjects), and a “just give it a try” spirit will be keys to your success.  Despite the use of video games for all the programming examples, PVG is not about computer games.  PVG will still provide valuable knowledge and skills for non-game computational problems.\n\nThe interactive learning objects (ILO) of the course provide automatic, context-specific guidance and feedback, like a virtual teaching assistant, as you develop problem descriptions, algorithms, and functional test plans.

The first module will introduce Spark, including how Spark works with distributed computing and what are Spark Dataframes. Module 2 covers the core concepts of Spark such as storage vs. computing, caching, partitions and Spark UI. The third module looks at Engineering Data Pipelines covering connecting to databases, schemas and type, file formats and writing good data. The final module looks at the application of Spark with Machine Learning through the business use case, a short introduction to what machine learning is, building and applying models and a final course conclusion. By understanding when to use Spark, either scaling out when the model or data is too large to process on a single machine, or having a need to simply speed up to get faster results, students will hone their SQL skills and become a more adept Data Scientist.",

In this framework reports are linked tightly to the underlying data and code, enhancing reproducibility and extensibility of completed analyses. We study out-of-memory approaches to the analysis of very large data resources, using relational databases or HDF5 as \"back ends\" with familiar R interfaces. Multiomic data integration is illustrated using a curated version of The Cancer Genome Atlas. Finally, we explore cloud-resident resources developed for the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (the ENCODE project). These address transcription factor binding, ATAC-seq, and RNA-seq with CRISPR interference.",

We will also go over quality control of FASTQ files; aligning RNA-seq reads; visualizing alignments and move on to analyzing RNA-seq at the gene-level : counting reads in genes; Exploratory Data Analysis and variance stabilization for counts; count-based differential expression; normalization and batch effects. Finally, we cover RNA-seq at the transcript-level : inferring expression of transcripts (i.e. alternative isoforms); differential exon usage. We will learn the basic steps in analyzing DNA methylation data, including reading the raw data, normalization, and finding regions of differential methylation across multiple samples. The course will end with a brief description of the basic steps for analyzing ChIP-seq datasets, from read alignment, to peak calling, and assessing differential binding patterns across multiple samples.",

Humans are natural network scientists, as we compute new network configurations all the time, almost unaware, when thinking about friends and family (which are particular forms of social networks), about colleagues and organizational relations (other, overlapping network structures), and about how to navigate delicate or opportunistic network configurations to save guard or advance in our social standing (with society being one big social network itself). While such network structures always existed, computational social science has helped to reveal and to study them more systematically. In the first part of the course we focus on network structure. This looks as static snapshots of networks, which can be intricate and reveal important aspects of social systems. In our hands-on lab, you will also visualize and analyze a network with a software yourself, which will help to appreciate the complexity social networks can take on. During the second part of the course, we will look at how networks evolve in time. We ask how we can predict what kind of network will form and if and how we could influence network dynamics.",

            "long_description": "Welcome to Logistic Regression in R for Public Health! \n\nWhy logistic regression for public health rather than just logistic regression? Well, there are some particular considerations for every data set, and public health data sets have particular features that need special attention. In a word, they're messy. Like the others in the series, this is a hands-on course, giving you plenty of practice with R on real-life, messy data, with predicting who has diabetes from a set of patient characteristics as the worked example for this course. Additionally, the interpretation of the outputs from the regression model can differ depending on the perspective that you take, and public health doesn’t just take the perspective of an individual patient but must also consider the population angle. That said, much of what is covered in this course is true for logistic regression when applied to any data set, so you will be able to apply the principles of this course to logistic regression more broadly too. \n\nBy the end of this course, you will be able to: \nExplain when it is valid to use logistic regression \nDefine odds and odds ratios \nRun simple and multiple logistic regression analysis in R and interpret the output \nEvaluate the model assumptions for multiple logistic regression in R \nDescribe and compare some common ways to choose a multiple regression model \n\nThis course builds on skills such as hypothesis testing, p values, and how to use R, which are covered in the first two courses of the Statistics for Public Health specialisation. If you are unfamiliar with these skills, we suggest you review Statistical Thinking for Public Health and Linear Regression for Public Health before beginning this course.

            "long_description": "Welcome to Linear Regression in R for Public Health!\n\nPublic Health has been defined as “the art and science of preventing disease, prolonging life and promoting health through the organized efforts of society”. Knowing what causes disease and what makes it worse are clearly vital parts of this. This requires the development of statistical models that describe how patient and environmental factors affect our chances of getting ill. This course will show you how to create such models from scratch, beginning with introducing you to the concept of correlation and  linear regression before walking you through importing and examining your data, and then showing you how to fit models. Using the example of respiratory disease, these models will describe how patient and other factors affect outcomes such as lung function. \n\nLinear regression is one of a family of regression models, and the other courses in this series will cover two further members. Regression models have many things in common with each other, though the mathematical details differ. \nThis course will show you how to prepare the data, assess how well the model fits the data, and test its underlying assumptions – vital tasks with any type of regression. \nYou will use the free and versatile software package R, used by statisticians and data scientists in academia, governments and industry worldwide.",

Random variables are used as a model for data generation processes we want to study. Properties of the data are deeply linked to the corresponding properties of random variables, such as expected value, variance and correlations. Dependencies between random variables are crucial factor that allows us to predict unknown quantities based on known values, which forms the basis of supervised machine learning. We begin with the notion of independent events and conditional probability, then introduce two main classes of random variables: discrete and continuous and study their properties. Finally, we learn different types of data and their connection with random variables.\n\nWhile introducing you to the theory, we'll pay special attention to practical aspects for working with probabilities, sampling, data analysis, and data visualization in Python.\n\nThis course requires basic knowledge in Discrete mathematics (combinatorics) and calculus (derivatives, integrals).",

However, since successful management of chronic disease must involve patients, using informatics tools and systems to engage them is now a major area of focus for academic and industry research and development. Much of our focus so far has been on the care of patients one at a time. Another major area of research and development involves the aggregation of data from large groups of patients to understand population (or public) health issues such as the factors external to traditional medicine that cause disease and that impact on our ability to treat it. Finally, digital health data is increasingly being used for research on methods to deploy predictive analytics to improve the diagnosis and treatment of disease as well as to run hospitals and health systems more cost effectively.",

The FPYA course is organized across eight separate modules within a 4-week window. Topics covered include financial goal setting, saving and investing, budgeting, financial risk, borrowing and credit. Because financial planning is such a personal topic, you will be encouraged to define your own financial goals and objectives while we discuss concepts and provide tools which can be applied in helping you reach those goals.\n\nWithin each module, you will view a combination of traditional lecture style videos along with video vignettes that introduce financial topics for discussion among participants. The video vignettes provide a unique and exciting component to this course. Each vignette introduces a real-world scenario where financial decisions must be made and financial planning concepts can be applied. You will be challenged to think critically about each scenario and decide how you might come to a resolution if ever faced with a similar situation.\n\nFinally, the course also includes material throughout which is focused on career opportunities in financial planning, including video interviews with actual CFP® professionals and other professionals working in this exciting and growing career area. The final module in the class is devoted to the topic of financial planning as a career.",

            "long_description": "This course provides students with a set of tools and methodologies to plan and initiate a Problem Solving or Quality Improvement project.  The first module presents methods for selecting, scoping and structuring a project before it is even initiated. It also introduces the project classifications of implementation and discovery. The second module describes the A3 problem solving methodology and the tool itself. Further in that same module, the student is shown tools to identify problems in flow, defects, and waste and to discover causes, brainstorm, and prioritize interventions. Module 3 shows a methodology within the implementation class. These methods are designed to overcome emotional and organizational barriers to translating evidence-based interventions into practice.  The fourth and last module looks at one more way to approach improvement projects in the discovery class.  These tools are specifically for new, out-of-the-box design thinking.",

If you are aiming to rise up in the ranks in your health system or looking to pivot your career in the direction of big data and health IT, this course is made for you. You'll hear from experts at Johns Hopkins about their experiences harnessing the power of big data in healthcare, improving EHR adoption, and separating out the hope vs hype when it comes to digital medicine. \n\nWhether you're a nurse, pharmacist, physician, other allied health professional or come from a non-clinical background--you know that Health Informatics skills are in demand. This newly launched 5-course specialization by JohnsHopkins faculty members provides a solid foundation for anyone wanting to become a leader in  one of the hottest fields in healthcare. \n\nAs health informaticians, we need to be very clear in our understanding of the current state (as-is), the future state (to-be) and any unintended consequences that can result from our interventions. Prior to introducing large scale change, we need to assess whether a healthcare organization is truly ready for change. This involves taking into account an organization's current culture and values. Successfully leading change through health informatics also requires strategic planning and careful financial considerations. Proper workflow redesign and a clear change management strategy are of utmost importance when introducing new technologies and in ensuring their successful adoption and proper use. \n\nBy the end of this course, students will become familiar with examples of successful and failed attempts at change in health informatics, and the reasons for each. Students will be armed with tools to help optimize their chances for successfully leading change in their respective organizations. ",

Are you willing to invest the effort to learn fundamental mathematical modeling techniques that are used in all subfields of robotics?\n\nIf so, then the \"Modern Robotics:  Mechanics, Planning, and Control\" specialization may be for you.  This specialization, consisting of six short courses, is serious preparation for serious students who hope to work in the field of robotics or to undertake advanced study.  It is not a sampler.\n\nIn Course 4 of the specialization, Robot Motion Planning and Control, you will learn key concepts of robot motion generation:  planning a motion for a robot in the presence of obstacles, and real-time feedback control to track the planned motion.  Chapter 10, Motion Planning, of the \"Modern Robotics\" textbook covers foundational material like C-space obstacles, graphs and trees, and graph search, as well as classical and modern motion planning techniques, such as grid-based motion planning, randomized sampling-based planners, and virtual potential fields.  Chapter 11, Robot Control, covers motion control, force control, and hybrid motion-force control.\n\nThis course follows the textbook \"Modern Robotics:  Mechanics, Planning, and Control\" (Lynch and Park, Cambridge University Press 2017).  You can purchase the book or use the free preprint pdf.  You will build on a library of robotics software in the language of your choice (among Python, Mathematica, and MATLAB) and use the free cross-platform robot simulator V-REP, which allows you to work with state-of-the-art robots in the comfort of your own home and with zero financial investment.",

Over these 9 weeks we will cover a number of theories, cases and applications in the field of communication science. We will start with the foundational concepts of communication theory, defining what the theory is and going through a number of approaches to communication itself.\n\nEach week you will have a test to check on your progress and understanding. We also have a final text in the end of the course and a little bit of writing. As Oscar Wilde said, if you cannot write, you cannot think. If you cannot think, others will do thinking for you. So we find writing and reflecting pretty important for our classes. Along the course we provide you with in-class materials: lecture presentations,  articles and additional readings. If you really want to get into the topic, don’t avoid this extra work.\n\nAlthough a substantial part of this course is theory-based, communication theory has a very practical application. Communication is an underlying process which creates and develops relationships, communities, societies. We communicative on a daily basis via a variety of means and channels. In our globalised and increasingly interconnected world, communication skills are essential in both the personal and professional spheres. It is our goal to leave you with a contextualisation and conceptualisation of communicative processes that will poise you to hone your own communicative skills — in other words, to put theory into practice.\n\nDo you have technical problems?

The portfolio includes three individual elements—a written memo, a slide deck, and a presentation—integrated around a single topic. We provide the elements for a basic capstone, but we also invite our learners to create their own project if they so choose. This self-designed \"Challenge Capstone\" allows learners to engage meaningfully in their world by choosing a project relevant to their current job or by volunteering to write, design, and speak for a social organization of their choice.\n \nBy successfully undertaking the Capstone, learners will accomplish three main goals: 1. They will hone their writing, design, and speaking skills and build a portfolio for a job search and/or professional application; 2. They will shape these skills into a unique brand identity; and, if they choose, 3. They will undertake a transformative effect in the world around them. Ultimately, the importance of Capstone portfolio is greater than the sum of its individual parts. Its true goal lies in each student’s personal transformation and expression of their best selves.

For most people and organizations, the actual problem solving phase is still very much a random process usually consisting of brain storming, trial-and-error and guesswork. Using structured and systematic innovation methodology allows for solving difficult problems in a shorter amount of time and with better results. Systematic innovation is a cornerstone for innovation strategies&nbsp;in some large multinational companies. <br /><br />The Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ) has gained a reputation for systematic problem analysis, problem-solving and system forecasting. TRIZ was developed in Russia based on decades of research. However, TRIZ is considered to be underutilized and not very well known internationally, especially within the life science sector. <br /><br />The course targets students, professionals and citizens with interest in innovation and entrepreneurship. Innovation essentials in the life science sector context will be presented, as well as TRIZ methods and principles. The aim of this course is to learn when, and how, to use all the tools in the &ldquo;tool box&rdquo;. Case studies will be shared, reviewed and discussed. <br /><br />Participants who complete and pass the course will be able to use structured and systematic innovation methodology in their projects. Many may be highly motivated to continue developing their skills in additional courses to gain deeper knowledge and potentially gain certification.<br /><br />This course is offered in collaboration with <a title=\"Research Institutes of Sweden\" href=\"https://www.ri.se/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">RISE</a>, <a title=\"Oxford Academic Health Science\" href=\"https://www.oxfordahsn.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Oxford AHSN</a> and <a title=\"EIT Health\" href=\"https://www.eithealth.eu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">EIT Health</a>.</",

            "long_description": "This short course surveys all the major topics covered in a full semester MBA level finance course, but with a more intuitive approach on a very high conceptual level.  The goal here is give you a roadmap and framework for how financial professional make decisions.  \n\nWe will cover the basics of financial valuation, the time value of money, compounding returns, and discounting the future.  You will understand discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation and how it compares to other methods.  We also step inside the mind of a corporate financial manager and develop the basic tools of capital budgeting.  We will survey the how, when, and where to spend money, make tradeoffs about investment, growth, dividends, and how to ensure sound fiscal discipline.  Our journey then turns to a Wall Street or capital markets perspective of investments as we discuss the fundamental tradeoff between risk and return.  We then synthesize our discussion of risk with our valuation framework and incorporate it into series of direct applications to practice.\n\nThis course requires no prior familiarity with finance.  Rather, it is intended to be a first step for anyone who is curious about understanding stock markets, valuation, or corporate finance.  We will walk through all of the tools and quantitative analysis together and develop a guide for understanding the seemingly complex decisions that finance professionals make.  \n\nBy the end of the course, you will develop an understanding of the major conceptual levers that push and pull on financial decision making and how they relate to other areas of business.  The course should also serve as a roadmap for where to further your finance education and it would be an excellent introduction of any students contemplating an MBA or Finance concentration, but who has little background in the area.",

            "long_description": "We make thousands of decisions every day. Do I cross the road now, or wait for the oncoming truck to pass? Should I eat fries or a salad for lunch? How much should I tip the cab driver? We usually make these decisions with almost no thought, using what psychologists call “heuristics” – rules of thumb that enable us to navigate our lives. Without these mental shortcuts, we would be paralyzed by the multitude of daily choices. But in certain circumstances, these shortcuts lead to predictable errors – predictable, that is, if we know what to watch out for. Did you know, for example, that we are naturally biased towards selling investments that are doing well for us, but holding on to those that are doing poorly? Or that we often select sub-optimal insurance payment plans, and routinely purchase insurance that we don’t even need? And why do so many of us fail to enroll in our employer’s corporate retirement plans, even when the employer offers to match our contributions?\n\nBehavioral finance is the study of these and dozens of other financial decision-making errors that can be avoided, if we are familiar with the biases that cause them. In this course, we examine these predictable errors, and discover where we are most susceptible to them. This course is intended to guide participants towards better financial choices. Learn how to improve your spending, saving, and investing decisions for the future.",

You will learn why interest rates have always been a key barometer in determining the value of everything.  You will explore the changing influence of interest rates; the impact of interest rates on consumption, investment and economic growth; and the bizarre realities of negative interest rates. Markets explains how interest rates change the value of all financial instruments, highlighting the role of the bond and stock markets that have toppled empires.  We take a closer look at the equity pricing models and equity markets that reverberate across the globe, and explore everything from the first stock ever issued – by the Dutch East India Company – to the little-understood but powerful derivative securities market.

We start by demonstrating why using debt has always been and continues to be a great temptation, particularly when borrowing costs are historically low. We identify conditions for selecting the optimal amount of debt for a corporation looking to maximize its value.  You’ll become fluent in related concepts like norms and benchmarks. You will explore these and other factors that influence debt for individuals and for public sector organizations -including governments, who are the largest consumers of debt. Like pollution, debt creates systemic risks even for the people and organizations that don’t create it. This course discusses the imperative of limiting and reducing debt and the costs to all of us if we don’t. We build on case based learning giving you opportunities  to interpret, uncover and acquire financial information that is often hidden or missing.

Sie eignen sich konkrete Werkzeuge an, die Ihnen helfen können, bessere Alltagsentscheidungen zu treffen und bekommen einen Einblick in verschiedene neueste Forschungserkenntnisse der Finance.\n\nWir begleiten Sie in sechs Wochenmodulen zu soliden finanziellen Alltagsentscheidungen. Nach einer Einführung erlernen Sie den Zeitwert des Geldes als zentrales Konzept zur Entscheidungsfindung. Überlegungen zur persönlichen Finanzplanung folgt das Basiswissen zur Geldanlage. Danach halten Sie inne und reflektieren die Frage der Werte anhand konkreter Beispiele, insbesondere in Bezug auf Finanzprodukte wie Derivate und Strukturierte Produkte. In einem Exkurs erhalten Sie auch Einblick in Bitcoin und Blockchain. Das Thema Geldanlage wird anschliessend vertieft: Sie begegnen dem grössten Feind des Anlegers und betrachten die Interaktion der Finanzmarktteilnehmenden in biologischen Analogien. Am Ende reflektieren Sie das Gehörte und Erlernte kritisch und nehmen hoffentlich viele konkrete Hilfsmittel in den Alltag mit.\n\nDie Inhalte der einzelnen Module können auch einzeln bearbeitet werden.

We discuss the core basis and mechanisms of modern corporate finance in a learner-friendly way. We will analyze the market’s most fundamental problems, realize the intrinsic interests and preferences of investors, reveal the true meaning of specific financial terms, and uncover important issues that are so often ignored in choosing and valuing investment projects.\nThe learners will gain insight into the essence of corporate finance. They will be able to use the obtained knowledge and skills to successfully advance in their career at a financial institution, as well as in the area of financial management at non-financial businesses.",

A mastery over these topics will help enhance your business decision making and allow you to understand and measure the extent of ‘risk’ or ‘uncertainty’ in various business processes. \nThis is the third course in the specialization \"Business Statistics and Analysis\" and the course  advances your knowledge about Business Statistics by introducing you to Confidence Intervals and Hypothesis Testing. We first conceptually understand these tools and their business application. We then introduce various calculations to constructing confidence intervals and to conduct different kinds of Hypothesis Tests. These are done by easy to understand applications.\n\nTo successfully complete course assignments, students must have access to a Windows version of Microsoft Excel 2010 or later. Please note that earlier versions of Microsoft Excel (2007 and earlier) will not be compatible to some Excel functions covered in this course. \n\n\nWEEK 1\nModule 1: Confidence Interval - Introduction\nIn this module you will get to conceptually understand what a confidence interval is and how is its constructed. We will introduce the various building blocks for the confidence interval such as the t-distribution, the t-statistic, the z-statistic and their various excel formulas. We will then use these building blocks to construct confidence intervals.\n\nTopics covered include:\n•\tIntroducing the t-distribution, the T.DIST and T.INV excel functions\n•\tConceptual understanding of a Confidence Interval\n•\tThe z-statistic and the t-statistic\n•\tConstructing a Confidence Interval using z-statistic and t-statistic \n\n\nWEEK 2\nModule 2: Confidence Interval - Applications\nThis module presents various business applications of the confidence interval including an application where we use the confidence interval to calculate an appropriate sample size. We also introduce with an application, the confidence interval for a population proportion. Towards the close of module we start introducing the concept of Hypothesis Testing.\n\nTopics covered include:\n•\tApplications of Confidence Interval\n•\tConfidence Interval for a Population Proportion\n•\tSample Size Calculation\n•\tHypothesis Testing, An Introduction\n\n\nWEEK 3\nModule 3: Hypothesis Testing\nThis module introduces Hypothesis Testing. You get to understand the logic behind hypothesis tests. The four steps for conducting a hypothesis test are introduced and you get to apply them for hypothesis tests for a population mean as well as population proportion. You will understand the difference between single tail hypothesis tests and two tail hypothesis tests and also the Type I and Type II errors associated with hypothesis tests and ways to reduce such errors. \n\nTopics covered include:\n•\tThe Logic of Hypothesis Testing\n•\tThe Four Steps for conducting a Hypothesis Test\n•\tSingle Tail and Two Tail Hypothesis Tests\n•\tGuidelines, Formulas and an Application of Hypothesis Test\n•\tHypothesis Test for a Population Proportion\n•\tType I and Type II Errors in a Hypothesis \n\n\nWEEK 4\nModule 4: Hypothesis Test - Differences in Mean\nIn this module, you'll apply Hypothesis Tests to test the difference between two different data, such hypothesis tests are called difference in means tests. We will introduce the three kinds of difference in means test and apply them to various business applications. We will also introduce the Excel dialog box to conduct such hypothesis tests.\n\nTopics covered include:\n•\tIntroducing the Difference-In-Means Hypothesis Test\n•\tApplications of the Difference-In-Means Hypothesis Test\n•\tThe Equal & Unequal Variance Assumption and the Paired t-test for difference in means.\n•\tSome more applications",

By hearing, seeing, and writing yourself, you will learn about classical, modern, ancient, pop, jazz, and folk styles.\n\nThrough lectures, relevant examples, and numerous practice assignments, we will examine fundamental aspects of melody. We will move into working with two voices and counterpoint, and finally to three voices and the beginnings of harmonic function.\n\nThis is an intermediate-level course for musicians and composers who already have some understanding of music theory through previous study. If you are a musician or composer looking to build a deeper understanding of music theory for composing, performing, or improvisation, you have come to the right place.

            "long_description": "This six-week course titled Doing Business in Europe is the second in a series of three exploring some of the main business aspects of European Union law. Besides providing learners with a sound knowledge base of European laws and regulations relevant to establishing and managing a company within the European Union, the course also explores business considerations within a broader perspective by including inputs from leading law practitioners in the field. More specifically, the course discusses strategic and financial considerations within Company law, as well as Labour law issues such as restructuring enterprises, working conditions and handling crises situations. The course also examines other legal areas such as Tax law, Environmental law and Private International law, and how they tie in to doing business in Europe.\n\nAt the end of this course, you will have a basic understanding of how to:\n\n· Understand the relevant regulations governing the internal European Union market\n\n· Establish and run a company within the European Union\n\n· Employ staff and recognize workers’ rights and obligations\n\n· Comply with tax regulations and environmental standards\n\n· Set up agreements and resolve cross-border disputes\n\n· Successfully analyse EU case law and draft case reports\n\n\nAbout the Series\n\nThe Lund series in European Business Law ranges from considering the basic structures and principles of the European Union to focusing on specialized areas of European Union law. The first course, Understanding the Fundamentals, examines the core structures and principles of the European Union. The third and final course, Competing in Europe, goes into depth concerning how to compete on the internal market and protect your brand, product or invention. All three courses can be taken independently or in sequence depending on your needs and preferences.\n\nTo keep up to speed on the course series, visit our Facebook page at:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/eblmooc/\n\n\nSyllabus and Format\n\nEach course consists of a number of modules where one module represents about one week of work. A module includes a number of lectures and readings, and finishes with an assessment – a quiz or a peer graded assignment. The assessments are intended to encourage learning and ensure that you understand the material of the course.

The University has 47 700 students and 7 500 staff based in Lund, Sweden. Lund University unites tradition with a modern, dynamic, and highly international profile. With eight different faculties and numerous research centers and specialized institutes, Lund is the strongest research university in Sweden and one of Scandinavia's largest institutions for education and research. The university annually attracts a large number of international students and offers a wide range of courses and programmes taught in English. \n\nThe Faulty of Law is one of Lund University’s four original faculties, dating back to 1666. It is a modern faculty with an international profile, welcoming both international and Swedish students. Education, research and interaction with the surrounding community are the main focus of the Faculty’s work. The connection between the three is particularly apparent in the programmes and courses offered by the university, including the university’s MOOC course in European Business Law. The students get the chance to engross themselves in traditional legal studies, while interacting with both researchers and professionally active lawyers with qualifications and experience from various areas of law.\nThe faculty offers three international Masters: two 2-year Master’s programmes in International Human Rights Law and European Business Law, and a 1-year Master’s in European and International Tax Law. Students from around 40 countries take part in the programmes which offer a unique subject specialization within each field, with highly qualified researchers and professional legal practitioners engaged in the teaching. \n\nThe Master’s programme in European Business Law provides an in-depth understanding of both the practical and the theoretical aspects of business law within the European Union. The programme provides both general and specific knowledge of the European Union legal framework, which is necessary for students intending to work as legal advisors or business decision-makers. The programme is delivered in English and is open to students with at least a three year degree in Law (Bachelor, LL.B, or equivalent) who want to specialise in European economic and business law.\nThe MOOC course in European Business Law is a great course to start with for students intending to apply for the Master’s programme in European Business Law. Even though the MOOC course does not grant credits previous knowledge of the subject is considered upon admission to the master’s programme.

We know that the culture of higher education is different from the culture of the military in meaningful ways, and we also know that one of the keys to excelling in college - especially for student veterans - is learning to navigate these differences successfully, right from the very start.<br /><br />This course aims to help you do just that. First, the course will orient you to the norms and expectations of the college classroom. The quicker you know what is expected of you, the quicker you can start learning. Second, the course will offer you strategies to ease your transition, to help you achieve your academic goals, and to allow you to make the most of your college education.<br /><br />While this course is open to everyone, the content has been tailored specifically for student veterans currently pursuing higher education, active duty servicemembers who aspire to start school or return to school soon, and higher education professionals who work to support student veterans at their schools. If this sounds like you, and if you&rsquo;re ready to learn how to make your transition easier and more successful, then we hope you&rsquo;ll join us.<br /><br />This online curriculum may be used in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, as a start-to finish, self-directed online experience (MOOC). It can also, in its current format, serve as an &ldquo;orientation&rdquo; for other student veteran success programs. We also invite you to utilize this resource as a library/toolkit of academic success strategies, a tool for flipped classroom pedagogy, or a companion text for on-the-ground transition courses.<br /><br />We welcome the opportunity to assist higher education institutions (both 2-year and 4-year), military installation education services officers and transition assistance programs, veteran focused non-profit organizations, and more. To get underway, contact us at the Columbia University Center for Veteran Transition and Integration.<",

In this course, we will look at the potential benefits of circular procurement and how recycling technologies and more efficient ways of collecting and recycling critical raw materials (CRMs) can make your business and production more resource resilient.<br /><br />A good number of the materials found in everyday&nbsp;products are now referred to as \"critical\". This means that there is a risk of failure in their supply&nbsp;and that they are also critical in terms of economic importance. <br /><br />Many metals, for instance, are already critical or could become critical in the near future due to their limited availability and the growing demand for products worldwide. Think of the newest electronic products that contain critical metals such as gallium, which is used in integrated circuits; beryllium, used in electronic and telecommunications equipment and permanent magnets and germanium found in infra-red optics.<br /><br />Innovative product design and reusing, recycling and remanufacturing products can help to deal with a raw materials shortage. But this can only provide an integrated solution if we keep CRMs in the loop through smarter CRM management. The starting point is to identify CRMs in products. It is not always clear what materials are in which products. It is, therefore, necessary to keep all metals in the loop for as long as possible.<br /><br />Scarcity in the supply chain can not only damage businesses but also&nbsp;negatively impact economic development and the environment. For this reason, the course will also discuss environmental issues and electric and electronic waste regulations.<br /><br />This course will be of value to a wide range of professionals working in or interested in this field. These include professionals involved in producing products containing CRMs (such as electronics) as well as local or national government officials tasked with organizing&nbsp;waste management and recycling for these products. Students interested in the field of waste management will also find this course helpful for their studies in electronics, industrial design, and industrial ecology.<br /><br /><em>This course has received funding from the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT). The EIT receives support from the European Union&rsquo;s Horizon2020 research and innovation program.</em></",

You'll hear from experts at Johns Hopkins about their experiences harnessing the power of big data in healthcare, improving EHR adoption, and separating out the hope vs hype when it comes to digital medicine. \n\nWhether you're a nurse, pharmacist, physician, other allied health professional or come from a non-clinical background--you know that Health Informatics skills are in demand. This newly launched 5-course specialization by JohnsHopkins faculty members provides a solid foundation for anyone wanting to become a leader in  one of the hottest fields in healthcare. \n\nAs health informaticians, we need to be very clear in our understanding of the current state (as-is), the future state (to-be) and any unintended consequences that can result from our interventions. Prior to introducing large scale change, we need to assess whether a healthcare organization is truly ready for change. This involves taking into account an organization's current culture and values. Successfully leading change through health informatics also requires strategic planning and careful financial considerations. Proper workflow redesign and a clear change management strategy are of utmost importance when introducing new technologies and in ensuring their successful adoption and proper use. \n\nBy the end of this course, students will become familiar with examples of successful and failed attempts at change in health informatics, and the reasons for each. Students will be armed with tools to help optimize their chances for successfully leading change in their respective organizations. ",

We know that the culture of higher education is different from the culture of the military in meaningful ways, and we also know that one of the keys to excelling in college - especially for student veterans - is learning to navigate these differences successfully, right from the very start.<br /><br />This course aims to help you do just that. First, the course will orient you to the norms and expectations of the college classroom. The quicker you know what is expected of you, the quicker you can start learning. Second, the course will offer you strategies to ease your transition, to help you achieve your academic goals, and to allow you to make the most of your college education.<br /><br />While this course is open to everyone, the content has been tailored specifically for student veterans currently pursuing higher education, active duty servicemembers who aspire to start school or return to school soon, and higher education professionals who work to support student veterans at their schools. If this sounds like you, and if you&rsquo;re ready to learn how to make your transition easier and more successful, then we hope you&rsquo;ll join us.<br /><br />This online curriculum may be used in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, as a start-to finish, self-directed online experience (MOOC). It can also, in its current format, serve as an &ldquo;orientation&rdquo; for other student veteran success programs. We also invite you to utilize this resource as a library/toolkit of academic success strategies, a tool for flipped classroom pedagogy, or a companion text for on-the-ground transition courses.<br /><br />We welcome the opportunity to assist higher education institutions (both 2-year and 4-year), military installation education services officers and transition assistance programs, veteran focused non-profit organizations, and more. To get underway, contact us at the Columbia University Center for Veteran Transition and Integration.<",

No matter which option you choose, the capstone project will examine your skills, including self-awareness, developing quality relationships and trust, resilience, and how making decisions entails a strong sense of responsibility.\n\nFor the personal challenge, you will work on your own question addressing your capacity to grow as a leader. A challenge can be a target objective (starting a company, running a project, designing a product, winning a competition, running a marathon…) you have for yourself which puts into question what you want to achieve and how. The Capstone will help you measure the challenge, establish a process and build the steps to meet your goals.\n\nWhatever personal challenge you choose, specific questions will attest to your capacity to analyze and criticize the the problem which is faced by by yourself.\n\nThe process that will drive the Business plan will follow step by step the relational circuit model developed in MOOC2 “Giving Sense to your Leadership Experience” and MOOC3 “Leading Organizations” with its two phases of Exploration and Projection.\n\nIn the EXPLORATION, you will engage in a first step of holistic perception of the problem using your sensible skills to give a sense of perspective and give voice to you subjective apprehension of the situation as a whole. The second stage of exploration will involve your analytical skills to understand each and every component (elements of data relevant to the challenge) that plays a role in defining the situation. And the third stage of exploration will apply your relational skills where you will make sense and connect your subjective perception with your analysis. You will share the exploration results with peers to receive feedback before your can move on.\n\nThe second phase, the PROJECTION part of your business plan leading to recommendations for the personal challenge at stake. In the projection phase you will first look at what the situation might be when you decenter the problem in time and space. Using benchmark and competitive analysis, you will work on different scenarios for the projected outcomes.

To this end, you will analyze the leadership and governance effectiveness of a real board of directors in an organization of your own choosing (or, if that is not possible, data gathered from a real board provided by the course instructors). By the end of the Capstone Project, you will have produced a professional consulting report detailing your analysis and recommendations to improve board leadership and governance effectiveness. You will then present it to the board and advise them on implementing change.\n\nTo learn more about this course, please watch the overview video by copying and pasting the following link into your web browser: https://goo.gl/GTWrN2\n\nKeywords: Nonprofit; Nonprofit Sector; Voluntary Sector; Nonprofit Organizations, Non-Governmental Organizations, Volunteer Organizations, Leadership, Management, Governance, Board, Board of Directors, Performance, Effectiveness\n\nCapstone Project Overview:\n\nWeeks 1-3: This period will be spent choosing a board of a nonprofit organization and gathering information using two specially designed tools and resources: The SUNY Open textbook (to download the book copy and paste the following link into your browser: http://tinyurl.com/peolnjb), \"Guidelines for Improving the Effectiveness of Boards of Directors of Nonprofit Organizations\", and The Board Check-Up, online board performance self-assessment tool that can be accessed by copying and pasting this link into your browser: https://www.boardcheckup.com. \n\nWeeks 4-5: In this phase, the information gathered will be analyzed leading to an evaluation of the board's effectiveness in the different dimensions of board effectiveness examined in the Specialization courses. \n\nWeeks 6-8: In the final phase of the Project, the results of the analysis and recommendations for positive change will be brought together a specially prepared consulting report intended for the use of the board of the client organization.",

Nevertheless, it is our hope that much of the course content will still be of value to those in other parts of the world. \n\nTo learn more about this course, please watch the overview video by copying and pasting the following link into your web browser: https://goo.gl/YMg1Qd.\n\nKeywords: Nonprofit; Nonprofit Sector; Voluntary Sector; Nonprofit Organizations, Non-Governmental Organizations, Volunteer Organizations, Leadership, Management, Governance, Board, Board of Directors, Performance, Effectiveness\n\nCourse 1 Overview: \n\nWeek 1: Some of the questions you will explore this week are: What is the nonprofit sector and why does it exist?  What are the unique characteristics of nonprofit organizations? What are the trends and emerging issues facing organizations in the nonprofit sector?\n\nWeek 2: Questions to be explored this week are: What is leadership at the governance level and how is it different from management?  What is good governance and why does it matter? What is a board of directors?\n\nWeek 3: This week's questions: What roles do board members play in nonprofit organizations? Broadly speaking, what are boards responsible for and how do they go about their work? What are some of the issues that challenge the board's ability to go its work?\n\nWeek 4: At this stage, you are asked to review the course content, submit a written assignment (known lightheartedly as a BEAR (Board Effectiveness Readiness Assessment), and take two multiple choice Readiness Assurance Tests (known similarly as RATs). One RAT will assess knowledge and reading comprehension and the other will test application of knowledge within a practical case.  \n\nWeek 5: We will encourage you to discuss the RATs in the discussion forums and take them again should you wish to change any of your answers based on the information exchanged.",

This definition of supervision states the relationship between the managers and their subordinates. This, however, doesn’t explain the manner in which coaches, instructors and mentors motivate people to take up leadership responsibilities for the first time in his/her life. Newly appointed managers find themselves in a new role of coordinating individual efforts in a team’s cause and that requires quickly adjusting to new roles, responsibilities and relationships. To be considered a successful supervisor, they need to develop their skills in administration, technology and interpersonal behavior. This tutorial is designed to help newly-appointed workplace supervisors get a better understanding of their roles and that of others.

I appreciate this work and encourage everyone to take a chance to learn from it.\n\nAs a veteran of over 200 MOOCs I must say it is very well organised and the ebook is a really worthwhile resource not only for this course but as a reference book beyond the course. It is obvious that a lot of work and effort went into producing the MOOC.\n\nGreat and thought-provoking content inside. Nicely-made!!\n\nIt is a creative way to address questions raised by the course.\n\nThis is great stuff!!!\n\nThe course content is well-chosen\n\nExcellent video clips!!!\n\nIt was perfect mix!\n\nRealistic view of success!\n\nI found Dr. Chun to be excellent!\n\nThis course was exactly what I needed!!\n\nA very well balanced course in total!\n\nVery clear, easy to follow and an engaging way of presenting complex matter!\n\nThis is a great course. I'm really grateful that you guys have made it and I found it!\n\nEverything was inspirational and many topics were new learning experience for me!\n\nI loved the fact that it included the lives of successful geniuses who practically demonstrated the practical thinking skills for a successful life.\n\nAs an engineer with limited knowledge of philosophy, I found the course very helpful to get in touch with it and get more interested in it.\n\nWe need more such course on Edx! I will hope to see more courses from Dr Jack Chun! I will also request you to at least run twice this course in a year. This year I audited the course. I hope to do this course with a verified certificate soon in next offering of this course.\n\nThis was a very interesting course that has made me to contemplate aspects of my life that require change for me to be successful, as well as giving me an understanding that the acquisition of material wealth will not necessarily equate to a successful life.\n\nThe learning from this course can be directly applied to the real life. Last night, I was watching a mock interview of an IAS officer (in India IAS is a very prestigious government job) and in the interview, they asked some questions by putting you in the situation. In answering those interview question I felt that the knowledge gained from this course helps a lot. I found an application there to solve those interview questions.\n\nThe part I like the most in the course was the interview question because there were 3 different good responses possible. I agree with the ideas of Kant in general, but I think in some instances, like the interview question, I will follow other philosopher's ideas.\n\nThe mix of ancient and modern gave a well-rounded perspective on practical and philosophical approaches to living a successful life. It was interesting to compare and contrast Aristotle, Kant and Mill with the more modern approaches.\n\nLive video and interviews with people such as Jack Ma or Bruce Lee are the key. The micro-movie dramatization was effective.\n\nI can recall information from the cartoons easier. I enjoy reading thoughts posted by other students.\n\nThe practical examples (i.e. cartoons on Kant, Aristotle and Mill) were very helpful to get across the points of their ideas.\n\n",

If you are aiming to rise up in the ranks in your health system or looking to pivot your career in the direction of big data and health IT, this course is made for you. You'll hear from experts at Johns Hopkins about their experiences harnessing the power of big data in healthcare, improving EHR adoption, and separating out the hope vs hype when it comes to digital medicine. \n\nWhether you're a nurse, pharmacist, physician, other allied health professional or come from a non-clinical background--you know that Health Informatics skills are in demand. This newly launched 5-course specialization by JohnsHopkins faculty members provides a solid foundation for anyone wanting to become a leader in  one of the hottest fields in healthcare. \n\nAs health informaticians, we need to be very clear in our understanding of the current state (as-is), the future state (to-be) and any unintended consequences that can result from our interventions. Prior to introducing large scale change, we need to assess whether a healthcare organization is truly ready for change. This involves taking into account an organization's current culture and values. Successfully leading change through health informatics also requires strategic planning and careful financial considerations. Proper workflow redesign and a clear change management strategy are of utmost importance when introducing new technologies and in ensuring their successful adoption and proper use. \n\nBy the end of this course, students will become familiar with examples of successful and failed attempts at change in health informatics, and the reasons for each. Students will be armed with tools to help optimize their chances for successfully leading change in their respective organizations. ",

We know that the culture of higher education is different from the culture of the military in meaningful ways, and we also know that one of the keys to excelling in college - especially for student veterans - is learning to navigate these differences successfully, right from the very start.<br /><br />This course aims to help you do just that. First, the course will orient you to the norms and expectations of the college classroom. The quicker you know what is expected of you, the quicker you can start learning. Second, the course will offer you strategies to ease your transition, to help you achieve your academic goals, and to allow you to make the most of your college education.<br /><br />While this course is open to everyone, the content has been tailored specifically for student veterans currently pursuing higher education, active duty servicemembers who aspire to start school or return to school soon, and higher education professionals who work to support student veterans at their schools. If this sounds like you, and if you&rsquo;re ready to learn how to make your transition easier and more successful, then we hope you&rsquo;ll join us.<br /><br />This online curriculum may be used in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, as a start-to finish, self-directed online experience (MOOC). It can also, in its current format, serve as an &ldquo;orientation&rdquo; for other student veteran success programs. We also invite you to utilize this resource as a library/toolkit of academic success strategies, a tool for flipped classroom pedagogy, or a companion text for on-the-ground transition courses.<br /><br />We welcome the opportunity to assist higher education institutions (both 2-year and 4-year), military installation education services officers and transition assistance programs, veteran focused non-profit organizations, and more. To get underway, contact us at the Columbia University Center for Veteran Transition and Integration.<",

These pressures compound stress related to workload and information processing – this not only reduces performance but can lead to a reduced sense of meaning and purpose as well as physical and mental health issues. Understanding stress and how to boost your resilience to it are essential skills for contemporary leaders and play a vital role in managing the demands you face at work. This course will focus on the nature of stressors facing leaders in today’s work environments and how to deal with them. You’ll explore personal resilience – your capacity to withstand and cope with stress – and strategies for self-management, motivation and organisation. You’ll also learn how resilience is impacted by health and social relationships.",

If you are aiming to rise up in the ranks in your health system or looking to pivot your career in the direction of big data and health IT, this course is made for you. You'll hear from experts at Johns Hopkins about their experiences harnessing the power of big data in healthcare, improving EHR adoption, and separating out the hope vs hype when it comes to digital medicine. \n\nWhether you're a nurse, pharmacist, physician, other allied health professional or come from a non-clinical background--you know that Health Informatics skills are in demand. This newly launched 5-course specialization by JohnsHopkins faculty members provides a solid foundation for anyone wanting to become a leader in  one of the hottest fields in healthcare. \n\nAs health informaticians, we need to be very clear in our understanding of the current state (as-is), the future state (to-be) and any unintended consequences that can result from our interventions. Prior to introducing large scale change, we need to assess whether a healthcare organization is truly ready for change. This involves taking into account an organization's current culture and values. Successfully leading change through health informatics also requires strategic planning and careful financial considerations. Proper workflow redesign and a clear change management strategy are of utmost importance when introducing new technologies and in ensuring their successful adoption and proper use. \n\nBy the end of this course, students will become familiar with examples of successful and failed attempts at change in health informatics, and the reasons for each. Students will be armed with tools to help optimize their chances for successfully leading change in their respective organizations. ",

We know that the culture of higher education is different from the culture of the military in meaningful ways, and we also know that one of the keys to excelling in college - especially for student veterans - is learning to navigate these differences successfully, right from the very start.<br /><br />This course aims to help you do just that. First, the course will orient you to the norms and expectations of the college classroom. The quicker you know what is expected of you, the quicker you can start learning. Second, the course will offer you strategies to ease your transition, to help you achieve your academic goals, and to allow you to make the most of your college education.<br /><br />While this course is open to everyone, the content has been tailored specifically for student veterans currently pursuing higher education, active duty servicemembers who aspire to start school or return to school soon, and higher education professionals who work to support student veterans at their schools. If this sounds like you, and if you&rsquo;re ready to learn how to make your transition easier and more successful, then we hope you&rsquo;ll join us.<br /><br />This online curriculum may be used in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, as a start-to finish, self-directed online experience (MOOC). It can also, in its current format, serve as an &ldquo;orientation&rdquo; for other student veteran success programs. We also invite you to utilize this resource as a library/toolkit of academic success strategies, a tool for flipped classroom pedagogy, or a companion text for on-the-ground transition courses.<br /><br />We welcome the opportunity to assist higher education institutions (both 2-year and 4-year), military installation education services officers and transition assistance programs, veteran focused non-profit organizations, and more.

I appreciate this work and encourage everyone to take a chance to learn from it.\n\nAs a veteran of over 200 MOOCs I must say it is very well organised and the ebook is a really worthwhile resource not only for this course but as a reference book beyond the course. It is obvious that a lot of work and effort went into producing the MOOC.\n\nGreat and thought-provoking content inside. Nicely-made!!\n\nIt is a creative way to address questions raised by the course.\n\nThis is great stuff!!!\n\nThe course content is well-chosen\n\nExcellent video clips!!!\n\nIt was perfect mix!\n\nRealistic view of success!\n\nI found Dr. Chun to be excellent!\n\nThis course was exactly what I needed!!\n\nA very well balanced course in total!\n\nVery clear, easy to follow and an engaging way of presenting complex matter!\n\nThis is a great course. I'm really grateful that you guys have made it and I found it!\n\nEverything was inspirational and many topics were new learning experience for me!\n\nI loved the fact that it included the lives of successful geniuses who practically demonstrated the practical thinking skills for a successful life.\n\nAs an engineer with limited knowledge of philosophy, I found the course very helpful to get in touch with it and get more interested in it.\n\nWe need more such course on Edx! I will hope to see more courses from Dr Jack Chun! I will also request you to at least run twice this course in a year. This year I audited the course. I hope to do this course with a verified certificate soon in next offering of this course.\n\nThis was a very interesting course that has made me to contemplate aspects of my life that require change for me to be successful, as well as giving me an understanding that the acquisition of material wealth will not necessarily equate to a successful life.\n\nThe learning from this course can be directly applied to the real life. Last night, I was watching a mock interview of an IAS officer (in India IAS is a very prestigious government job) and in the interview, they asked some questions by putting you in the situation. In answering those interview question I felt that the knowledge gained from this course helps a lot. I found an application there to solve those interview questions.\n\nThe part I like the most in the course was the interview question because there were 3 different good responses possible. I agree with the ideas of Kant in general, but I think in some instances, like the interview question, I will follow other philosopher's ideas.\n\nThe mix of ancient and modern gave a well-rounded perspective on practical and philosophical approaches to living a successful life. It was interesting to compare and contrast Aristotle, Kant and Mill with the more modern approaches.\n\nLive video and interviews with people such as Jack Ma or Bruce Lee are the key. The micro-movie dramatization was effective.\n\nI can recall information from the cartoons easier. I enjoy reading thoughts posted by other students.\n\nThe practical examples (i.e. cartoons on Kant, Aristotle and Mill) were very helpful to get across the points of their ideas.\n\n",

It can sometimes be challenging to step back and reflect in an environment which is fast paced or when you are required to assimilate large amounts of information. Making sense of or communicating new ideas in an innovative and engaging way, approaching problems from fresh angles, and producing novel solutions are all traits which are highly sought after by employers.\n\nThis course will equip you with a ‘tool-box’, introducing you to a selection of behaviours and techniques that will augment your innate creativity. Some of the tools are suited to use on your own and others work well for a group, enabling you to leverage the power of several minds.  You can pick and choose which of these tools or techniques suit your needs and interests, focusing on some or all of the selected approaches and in the order that fits best for you.\n\nThe practical approach of this course enables you to acquire an essential skill-set for generating ideas, with plenty of:\n- Fun e-tivities and exercises;\n- Practical lectures and tips;\n- Video representations of the techniques in action.\n\nBy the end of this course you should be able to:\n- Pick a type of brainstorming you think will be useful to apply to a challenge\n- Use alphabet brainstorming in tackling a challenge\n- Use grid brainstorming in tackling a challenge\n- Use a morphological chart to synthesise a solution to a challenge\n- Use the TRIZ contradiction matrix to identify recommended inventive principles\n- Apply SCAMPER to a range of challenges\n\nThe greatest innovators aren’t necessarily the people who have the most original idea. Often, they are people- or teams- that have harnessed their creativity to develop a new perspective or more effective way of communicating an idea. You can train your imagination to seize opportunities, break away from routine and habit, and tap into your natural creativity.\n\nJoin this course and our community of practitioners in CREATIVITY!",

For most people and organizations, the actual problem solving phase is still very much a random process usually consisting of brain storming, trial-and-error and guesswork. Using structured and systematic innovation methodology allows for solving difficult problems in a shorter amount of time and with better results. Systematic innovation is a cornerstone for innovation strategies&nbsp;in some large multinational companies. <br /><br />The Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ) has gained a reputation for systematic problem analysis, problem-solving and system forecasting. TRIZ was developed in Russia based on decades of research. However, TRIZ is considered to be underutilized and not very well known internationally, especially within the life science sector. <br /><br />The course targets students, professionals and citizens with interest in innovation and entrepreneurship. Innovation essentials in the life science sector context will be presented, as well as TRIZ methods and principles. The aim of this course is to learn when, and how, to use all the tools in the &ldquo;tool box&rdquo;. Case studies will be shared, reviewed and discussed. <br /><br />Participants who complete and pass the course will be able to use structured and systematic innovation methodology in their projects. Many may be highly motivated to continue developing their skills in additional courses to gain deeper knowledge and potentially gain certification.<br /><br />This course is offered in collaboration with <a title=\"Research Institutes of Sweden\" href=\"https://www.ri.se/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">RISE</a>, <a title=\"Oxford Academic Health Science\" href=\"https://www.oxfordahsn.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Oxford AHSN</a> and <a title=\"EIT Health\" href=\"https://www.eithealth.eu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">EIT Health</a>.</",

Agile-подходы бурно развиваются в России не только в разработке программного обеспечения, но также в банках, промышленности и других сферах. Вы сможете понять и применить приведенные в курсе примеры независимо от того, разрабатываете ли вы софт или совсем не связаны с ИТ-индустрией. \n\nОба преподавателя курса имеют уникальный практический опыт. Они были разработчиками, менеджерами проектов, руководителями разработки и т.п. А за последние годы — в роли консультантов и тренеров — они помогли десяткам организаций повысить свою эффективность за счет Agile. Подобный опыт на русском языке до сих пор можно было узнать только на дорогостоящих очных тренингах и конференциях.\n\nКурс включает не только видео и тесты. Наибольшую пользу вы получите, выполняя разнообразные задания: например, создавая свою скрам-доску или анализируя ситуации из вашей работы с точки зрения Agile-принципов.\n\nБольшое внимание в курсе уделяется практическим вопросам типа «Как “продать” Agile руководству и команде?», а также путям вашего профессионального и карьерного роста в гибких организациях.\n\nКурс полезен всем, кто хочет применять Agile и Scrum в своей работе, – от программиста до технического директора. Но максимальный объем знаний и навыков от курса получат тимлиды, менеджеры проектов и другие руководители: для них в курсе предусмотрены дополнительные задания, например, «Устранение пороков вашей команды», «Чек-лист правильного Скрама».",

The course is focused on practical design-oriented modeling and control of pulse-width modulated switched mode power converters using analytical and simulation tools in time and frequency domains. A design-oriented analysis technique known as the Middlebrook's feedback theorem is introduced and applied to analysis and design of voltage regulators and other feedback circuits. Furthermore, it is shown how circuit averaging and averaged-switch modeling techniques lead to converter averaged models suitable for hand analysis, computer-aided analysis, and simulations of converters. After completion of this course, the student will be able to practice design of high-performance control loops around switched-mode power converters using analytical and simulation techniques. \n\nWe strongly recommend students complete the CU Boulder Power Electronics specialization before enrolling in this course (course numbers provided for students in CU Boulder's MS-EE program):\n \n● Introduction to Power Electronics (ECEA 5700)\n● Converter Circuits (ECEA 5701)\n● Converter Control (ECEA 5702)\n\nAfter completing this course, you will be able to:\n\n● Explain operation and modeling of switched-mode power converters\n● Model open-loop transfer functions and frequency responses\n● Design closed-loop regulated switched-mode power converters\n● Verify operation of switched-mode power converters by simulations\n● Understand the Feedback Theorem principles\n● Apply the Feedback Theorem to practical design examples\n● Derive averaged switch models of and averaged circuit models of power converters\n● Apply averaged-switch modeling techniques to analysis and design and simulations of power converters",

It weaves inputs from these various fields into a series of lectures and experiential exercises.&nbsp;<br /><br />This course is for anyone who wants to reinvent the way they currently approach and experience their work and their career. It takes an inside-out approach to create change. The focus is on working on one&rsquo;s own mental models and beliefs with regard to work, career, success, failure, and identity. <br /><br />Participants will benefit&nbsp;on three levels. <br /><br />At an intellectual level, they will learn how the brain functions, the way emotions influence the functioning of the brain, and the way the brain receives, processes and makes sense of information. Participants will understand how sensemaking in the brain directly and indirectly translates into behavior; thereby influencing a person&rsquo;s subjective as well as objective experience at work. &nbsp;<br /><br />At an experiential level, participants will get to participate in reflective exercises that will allow them to gain a richer and deeper awareness of their own past experiences. They will be able to see and understand the role that their own choices, attitudes and beliefs played in the way their life has unfolded so far. They will also be able to realize the role that other people and society have played in the shaping of their beliefs and attitudes.<br /><br />At a practical level, participants will learn tried and tested tools that will help them create the change they desire and craft their own future work experience with greater levels of confidence and effectiveness. These include emotional tools from the field of positive psychology, psychological tools that are used in coaching, and established behavioral tools from the field of organizational behavior.<br /><br />The course is practical, engaging, and potent in its design with a unique mix of lectures, stories, and reflective exercises.

It weaves inputs from these various fields into a series of lectures and experiential exercises.&nbsp;<br /><br />This course is for anyone who wants to reinvent the way they currently approach and experience their work and their career. It takes an inside-out approach to create change. The focus is on working on one&rsquo;s own mental models and beliefs with regard to work, career, success, failure, and identity. <br /><br />Participants will benefit&nbsp;on three levels. <br /><br />At an intellectual level, they will learn how the brain functions, the way emotions influence the functioning of the brain, and the way the brain receives, processes and makes sense of information. Participants will understand how sensemaking in the brain directly and indirectly translates into behavior; thereby influencing a person&rsquo;s subjective as well as objective experience at work. &nbsp;<br /><br />At an experiential level, participants will get to participate in reflective exercises that will allow them to gain a richer and deeper awareness of their own past experiences. They will be able to see and understand the role that their own choices, attitudes and beliefs played in the way their life has unfolded so far. They will also be able to realize the role that other people and society have played in the shaping of their beliefs and attitudes.<br /><br />At a practical level, participants will learn tried and tested tools that will help them create the change they desire and craft their own future work experience with greater levels of confidence and effectiveness. These include emotional tools from the field of positive psychology, psychological tools that are used in coaching, and established behavioral tools from the field of organizational behavior.<br /><br />The course is practical, engaging, and potent in its design with a unique mix of lectures, stories, and reflective exercises. These reflective exercises have been shown to create deep and lasting change for the participants.
