Turn your game ideas into game realities and build on an important set of skills in this JavaScript library. Learn how to make and curate interactive experiences and deploy your games to the web!\nWhy Learn Phaser?\nPhaser is the biggest HTML5 game development framework on the market. It has been used for browser games, mobile games, and desktop games. Learn how to use this library to make games for yourself!\nNote on Prerequisites\nPhaser is built in JavaScript and we will be writing JavaScript code throughout the course, so knowledge of JavaScript (especially functions and objects) will be useful. However, the course is as beginner-friendly as possible and can be attempted without any prior JavaScript knowledge. Still, if Phaser concepts and instructions seem a bit murky it might be best to take a few sections of our Introduction to JavaScript course to build conceptual knowledge.\nWhat Will You Build?\nYou’ll build eight games in this course: \n\nColor a Pegasus: a coloring book application with an eye-catching aesthetic!\nCreate an Adventure: a dungeon crawling text-based adventure game about a dungeon with an orc, a knight, a wizard, and you.\nBug Dodger: Avoid the cascading torrent of bugs and try to get a high score!\nBug Invaders: The bugs are descending to earth and it’s up to you to stop them!\nCodey’s Cave Crisis: learn the basics of how to create the quintessential platformer! \nCodey’s Counting Conundrum: Build a multi-scened game that incorporates tweens and animations. \nTundra Terror: Guide Codey through a frozen tundra brought to life through stunning visual effects.\nCodey Jump: Recreate an app classic that has Codey jumping endlessly upward. \n\n ",
