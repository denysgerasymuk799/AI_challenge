Our language of choice, Python, is an easy-to learn, high-level computer language that is used in many of the computational courses offered on Coursera. To make learning Python easy, we have developed a new browser-based programming environment that makes developing interactive applications in Python simple. These applications will involve windows whose contents are graphical and respond to buttons, the keyboard and the mouse.\n\nIn part 2 of this course, we will introduce more elements of programming (such as list, dictionaries, and loops) and then use these elements to create games such as Blackjack.  Part 1 of this class will culminate in building a version of the classic arcade game \"Asteroids\".  Upon completing this course, you will be able to write small, but interesting Python programs.  The next course in the specialization will begin to introduce a more principled approach to writing programs and solving computational problems that will allow you to write larger and more complex programs.",

Logistic Regression is an important fundamental concept if you want break into Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Even though popular machine learning frameworks have implementations of logistic regression available, it's still a great idea to learn to implement it on your own to understand the mechanics of optimization algorithm, and the training and validation process.\n\nSince this is a practical, project-based course, you will need to have a theoretical understanding of logistic regression, and gradient descent. We will focus on the practical aspect of implementing logistic regression with gradient descent, but not on the theoretical aspect.\n\nBy the end of this course, you would create and train a logistic model that will be able to predict if a given image is of hand-written digit zero or of hand-written digit one. The model will be able to distinguish between images or 0s and 1s, and it will do that with a very high accuracy. Not only that, your implementation of the logistic model will also be able to solve any generic binary classiﬁcation problem. You will still have to train model instances on speciﬁc datasets of course, but you won’t have to change the implementation and it will be re-usable. The dataset for images of hand written digits comes from the popular MNIST dataset. This data set consists of images for the 10 hand-written digits (from 0 to 9), but since we are implementing logistic regression, and are looking to solve binary classiﬁcation problems - we will work with examples of hand written zeros, and hand written ones and we will ignore examples of rest of the digits.\n\nThis course runs on Coursera's hands-on project platform called Rhyme. On Rhyme, you do projects in a hands-on manner in your browser. You will get instant access to pre-configured cloud desktops containing all of the software and data you need for the project. Everything is already set up directly in your internet browser so you can just focus on learning. For this project, you’ll get instant access to a cloud desktop with Python, Jupyter, and Tensorflow pre-installed.\n\nNotes:\n-  You will be able to access the cloud desktop 5 times. However, you will be able to access instructions videos as many times as you want.\n- This course works best for learners who are based in the North America region. We’re currently working on providing the same experience in other regions.",

The first module will introduce Spark, including how Spark works with distributed computing and what are Spark Dataframes. Module 2 covers the core concepts of Spark such as storage vs. computing, caching, partitions and Spark UI. The third module looks at Engineering Data Pipelines covering connecting to databases, schemas and type, file formats and writing good data. The final module looks at the application of Spark with Machine Learning through the business use case, a short introduction to what machine learning is, building and applying models and a final course conclusion. By understanding when to use Spark, either scaling out when the model or data is too large to process on a single machine, or having a need to simply speed up to get faster results, students will hone their SQL skills and become a more adept Data Scientist.",

Topics covered include financial goal setting, saving and investing, budgeting, financial risk, borrowing and credit. Because financial planning is such a personal topic, you will be encouraged to define your own financial goals and objectives while we discuss concepts and provide tools which can be applied in helping you reach those goals.\n\nWithin each module, you will view a combination of traditional lecture style videos along with video vignettes that introduce financial topics for discussion among participants. The video vignettes provide a unique and exciting component to this course. Each vignette introduces a real-world scenario where financial decisions must be made and financial planning concepts can be applied. You will be challenged to think critically about each scenario and decide how you might come to a resolution if ever faced with a similar situation.\n\nFinally, the course also includes material throughout which is focused on career opportunities in financial planning, including video interviews with actual CFP® professionals and other professionals working in this exciting and growing career area. The final module in the class is devoted to the topic of financial planning as a career.",

You'll hear from experts at Johns Hopkins about their experiences harnessing the power of big data in healthcare, improving EHR adoption, and separating out the hope vs hype when it comes to digital medicine. \n\nWhether you're a nurse, pharmacist, physician, other allied health professional or come from a non-clinical background--you know that Health Informatics skills are in demand. This newly launched 5-course specialization by JohnsHopkins faculty members provides a solid foundation for anyone wanting to become a leader in  one of the hottest fields in healthcare. \n\nAs health informaticians, we need to be very clear in our understanding of the current state (as-is), the future state (to-be) and any unintended consequences that can result from our interventions. Prior to introducing large scale change, we need to assess whether a healthcare organization is truly ready for change. This involves taking into account an organization's current culture and values. Successfully leading change through health informatics also requires strategic planning and careful financial considerations. Proper workflow redesign and a clear change management strategy are of utmost importance when introducing new technologies and in ensuring their successful adoption and proper use. \n\nBy the end of this course, students will become familiar with examples of successful and failed attempts at change in health informatics, and the reasons for each. Students will be armed with tools to help optimize their chances for successfully leading change in their respective organizations. ",

Are you willing to invest the effort to learn fundamental mathematical modeling techniques that are used in all subfields of robotics?\n\nIf so, then the \"Modern Robotics:  Mechanics, Planning, and Control\" specialization may be for you.  This specialization, consisting of six short courses, is serious preparation for serious students who hope to work in the field of robotics or to undertake advanced study.  It is not a sampler.\n\nIn Course 4 of the specialization, Robot Motion Planning and Control, you will learn key concepts of robot motion generation:  planning a motion for a robot in the presence of obstacles, and real-time feedback control to track the planned motion.  Chapter 10, Motion Planning, of the \"Modern Robotics\" textbook covers foundational material like C-space obstacles, graphs and trees, and graph search, as well as classical and modern motion planning techniques, such as grid-based motion planning, randomized sampling-based planners, and virtual potential fields.  Chapter 11, Robot Control, covers motion control, force control, and hybrid motion-force control.\n\nThis course follows the textbook \"Modern Robotics:  Mechanics, Planning, and Control\" (Lynch and Park, Cambridge University Press 2017).  You can purchase the book or use the free preprint pdf.

Over these 9 weeks we will cover a number of theories, cases and applications in the field of communication science. We will start with the foundational concepts of communication theory, defining what the theory is and going through a number of approaches to communication itself.\n\nEach week you will have a test to check on your progress and understanding. We also have a final text in the end of the course and a little bit of writing. As Oscar Wilde said, if you cannot write, you cannot think. If you cannot think, others will do thinking for you. So we find writing and reflecting pretty important for our classes. Along the course we provide you with in-class materials: lecture presentations,  articles and additional readings. If you really want to get into the topic, don’t avoid this extra work.\n\nAlthough a substantial part of this course is theory-based, communication theory has a very practical application. Communication is an underlying process which creates and develops relationships, communities, societies. We communicative on a daily basis via a variety of means and channels. In our globalised and increasingly interconnected world, communication skills are essential in both the personal and professional spheres. It is our goal to leave you with a contextualisation and conceptualisation of communicative processes that will poise you to hone your own communicative skills — in other words, to put theory into practice.\n\nDo you have technical problems?

Instead, you should think of them as virtual classes where you are supposed to reflect, complete activities, and even get extra practice on your own time.

Modern business requires communication skills that are effective across cultures, generations, and genders. Communication is also a key skill in building your personal brand. Leaders need to look, act, and speak like leaders. Another important leadership skill is the ability to handle difficult, emotional communications with employees, supervisors, and colleagues. Finally, engineers are often at the center of crisis communication.\n\nIn this course, you will learn\n1. How to communicate in a global environment, \n2. How to communicate across cultures, generations, and genders\n3. How to use communication to build your personal brand, communicate your values, and your leadership promise\n4. How to handle high-stakes, emotionally charged, difficult conversations with employees, supervisors and your colleagues\n5. How to handle crisis communication\n\n\nRequired Material Disclaimer- The purchase of a case study is necessary to complete this course, as it is tied to an assessment.

The portfolio includes three individual elements—a written memo, a slide deck, and a presentation—integrated around a single topic. We provide the elements for a basic capstone, but we also invite our learners to create their own project if they so choose. This self-designed \"Challenge Capstone\" allows learners to engage meaningfully in their world by choosing a project relevant to their current job or by volunteering to write, design, and speak for a social organization of their choice.\n \nBy successfully undertaking the Capstone, learners will accomplish three main goals: 1. They will hone their writing, design, and speaking skills and build a portfolio for a job search and/or professional application; 2. They will shape these skills into a unique brand identity; and, if they choose, 3. They will undertake a transformative effect in the world around them. Ultimately, the importance of Capstone portfolio is greater than the sum of its individual parts. Its true goal lies in each student’s personal transformation and expression of their best selves. We invite you to unleash your skills and we can't wait to see the results!",

While learning about agile mainstays like Scrum, XP, and kanban, you’ll also learn to help your team ask the right questions about how they’re working and facilitate good answers on how agile can help.    \n\nAs a  Project Management Institute (PMI®) Registered Education Provider, the University of Virginia Darden School of Business has been approved by PMI to issue 20 professional development units (PDUs) for this course, which focuses on core competencies recognized by PMI. (Provider #2122) \n\nThis course is supported by the Batten Institute at UVA’s Darden School of Business.

These levels range from the external “world” in which the institution operates down to the specific technologies. Data scientists find that, when they aim at implementing their models in practice, it is the “socio” components that are both novel to them and mission critical to success. At the end of this course, students will be able to make a quick assessment of a health informatics problem—or a proposed solution—and to determine what is missing and what more needs to be learned.\n\nWho Is This Class For? \nPhysicians, nurses, pharmacists, social workers, and other allied health professionals interested in expanding their understanding of digital health, big data, health information systems, and the unintended consequences of disruptive innovation in the healthcare system. The course is also aimed at those with technical, engineering, or analytics backgrounds who want to understand the nuances of those topics when it comes to healthcare.",

For most people and organizations, the actual problem solving phase is still very much a random process usually consisting of brain storming, trial-and-error and guesswork. Using structured and systematic innovation methodology allows for solving difficult problems in a shorter amount of time and with better results. Systematic innovation is a cornerstone for innovation strategies&nbsp;in some large multinational companies. <br /><br />The Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ) has gained a reputation for systematic problem analysis, problem-solving and system forecasting. TRIZ was developed in Russia based on decades of research. However, TRIZ is considered to be underutilized and not very well known internationally, especially within the life science sector. <br /><br />The course targets students, professionals and citizens with interest in innovation and entrepreneurship. Innovation essentials in the life science sector context will be presented, as well as TRIZ methods and principles. The aim of this course is to learn when, and how, to use all the tools in the &ldquo;tool box&rdquo;. Case studies will be shared, reviewed and discussed. <br /><br />Participants who complete and pass the course will be able to use structured and systematic innovation methodology in their projects. Many may be highly motivated to continue developing their skills in additional courses to gain deeper knowledge and potentially gain certification.<br /><br />This course is offered in collaboration with <a title=\"Research Institutes of Sweden\" href=\"https://www.ri.se/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">RISE</a>, <a title=\"Oxford Academic Health Science\" href=\"https://www.oxfordahsn.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Oxford AHSN</a> and <a title=\"EIT Health\" href=\"https://www.eithealth.eu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">EIT Health</a>.</",

            "short_description": "Many industry observers have debated on the origin of entrepreneurship. The fact to note here is that most scholars who debate the origin of entrepreneurship are either economists or historians. The common forum accepts that the concept entrepreneur is derived from the French concept entreprendre, which matches closely with the English concept of business conduct; in this sense – “to undertake”. From the business point of view, to undertake simply means to start a business. This is an introductory tutorial that will help the readers to get a basic understanding on the concepts of entrepreneurship skills. The entrepreneurship theory has been changing throughout many decades of business growth and has received numerous definitions and characteristics from different scholars, who believe that some qualities are common among most entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurship’s foundations are based on economics and other such disciplines such as History, Politics, Education, Culture, Experience and Networking. ",

            "long_description": "Confidence intervals and Hypothesis tests are very important tools in the Business Statistics toolbox. A mastery over these topics will help enhance your business decision making and allow you to understand and measure the extent of ‘risk’ or ‘uncertainty’ in various business processes. \nThis is the third course in the specialization \"Business Statistics and Analysis\" and the course  advances your knowledge about Business Statistics by introducing you to Confidence Intervals and Hypothesis Testing. We first conceptually understand these tools and their business application. We then introduce various calculations to constructing confidence intervals and to conduct different kinds of Hypothesis Tests. These are done by easy to understand applications.\n\nTo successfully complete course assignments, students must have access to a Windows version of Microsoft Excel 2010 or later. Please note that earlier versions of Microsoft Excel (2007 and earlier) will not be compatible to some Excel functions covered in this course. \n\n\nWEEK 1\nModule 1: Confidence Interval - Introduction\nIn this module you will get to conceptually understand what a confidence interval is and how is its constructed. We will introduce the various building blocks for the confidence interval such as the t-distribution, the t-statistic, the z-statistic and their various excel formulas. We will then use these building blocks to construct confidence intervals.\n\nTopics covered include:\n•\tIntroducing the t-distribution, the T.DIST and T.INV excel functions\n•\tConceptual understanding of a Confidence Interval\n•\tThe z-statistic and the t-statistic\n•\tConstructing a Confidence Interval using z-statistic and t-statistic \n\n\nWEEK 2\nModule 2: Confidence Interval - Applications\nThis module presents various business applications of the confidence interval including an application where we use the confidence interval to calculate an appropriate sample size. We also introduce with an application, the confidence interval for a population proportion. Towards the close of module we start introducing the concept of Hypothesis Testing.\n\nTopics covered include:\n•\tApplications of Confidence Interval\n•\tConfidence Interval for a Population Proportion\n•\tSample Size Calculation\n•\tHypothesis Testing, An Introduction\n\n\nWEEK 3\nModule 3: Hypothesis Testing\nThis module introduces Hypothesis Testing. You get to understand the logic behind hypothesis tests. The four steps for conducting a hypothesis test are introduced and you get to apply them for hypothesis tests for a population mean as well as population proportion. You will understand the difference between single tail hypothesis tests and two tail hypothesis tests and also the Type I and Type II errors associated with hypothesis tests and ways to reduce such errors. \n\nTopics covered include:\n•\tThe Logic of Hypothesis Testing\n•\tThe Four Steps for conducting a Hypothesis Test\n•\tSingle Tail and Two Tail Hypothesis Tests\n•\tGuidelines, Formulas and an Application of Hypothesis Test\n•\tHypothesis Test for a Population Proportion\n•\tType I and Type II Errors in a Hypothesis \n\n\nWEEK 4\nModule 4: Hypothesis Test - Differences in Mean\nIn this module, you'll apply Hypothesis Tests to test the difference between two different data, such hypothesis tests are called difference in means tests. We will introduce the three kinds of difference in means test and apply them to various business applications. We will also introduce the Excel dialog box to conduct such hypothesis tests.\n\nTopics covered include:\n•\tIntroducing the Difference-In-Means Hypothesis Test\n•\tApplications of the Difference-In-Means Hypothesis Test\n•\tThe Equal & Unequal Variance Assumption and the Paired t-test for difference in means.\n•\tSome more applications",

Explore how culture, psychology, physics, formal context, and a sense of play all shape musical language.

            "long_description": "This course is about how music works. It is about the relationship between the technical and aesthetic details of music. It is also about how developing a meaningful theoretical vocabulary can help you think and talk about musical style, and how learning that vocabulary can expand your appreciation for music.\n\nIn this course you will learn music theory not by looking at theory itself, but by listening to, looking at, and—yes!—writing your own musical examples. By hearing, seeing, and writing yourself, you will learn about classical, modern, ancient, pop, jazz, and folk styles.\n\nThrough lectures, relevant examples, and numerous practice assignments, we will examine fundamental aspects of melody. We will move into working with two voices and counterpoint, and finally to three voices and the beginnings of harmonic function.\n\nThis is an intermediate-level course for musicians and composers who already have some understanding of music theory through previous study. If you are a musician or composer looking to build a deeper understanding of music theory for composing, performing, or improvisation, you have come to the right place. If you are an amateur lover of music or, perhaps, play a musical instrument and want to develop a deeper sense of appreciation for music theory, aesthetics, and history, you are also in the right place!",

            "long_description": "This six-week course titled Doing Business in Europe is the second in a series of three exploring some of the main business aspects of European Union law. Besides providing learners with a sound knowledge base of European laws and regulations relevant to establishing and managing a company within the European Union, the course also explores business considerations within a broader perspective by including inputs from leading law practitioners in the field. More specifically, the course discusses strategic and financial considerations within Company law, as well as Labour law issues such as restructuring enterprises, working conditions and handling crises situations. The course also examines other legal areas such as Tax law, Environmental law and Private International law, and how they tie in to doing business in Europe.\n\nAt the end of this course, you will have a basic understanding of how to:\n\n· Understand the relevant regulations governing the internal European Union market\n\n· Establish and run a company within the European Union\n\n· Employ staff and recognize workers’ rights and obligations\n\n· Comply with tax regulations and environmental standards\n\n· Set up agreements and resolve cross-border disputes\n\n· Successfully analyse EU case law and draft case reports\n\n\nAbout the Series\n\nThe Lund series in European Business Law ranges from considering the basic structures and principles of the European Union to focusing on specialized areas of European Union law. The first course, Understanding the Fundamentals, examines the core structures and principles of the European Union. The third and final course, Competing in Europe, goes into depth concerning how to compete on the internal market and protect your brand, product or invention. All three courses can be taken independently or in sequence depending on your needs and preferences.\n\nTo keep up to speed on the course series, visit our Facebook page at:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/eblmooc/\n\n\nSyllabus and Format\n\nEach course consists of a number of modules where one module represents about one week of work.

The University has 47 700 students and 7 500 staff based in Lund, Sweden. Lund University unites tradition with a modern, dynamic, and highly international profile. With eight different faculties and numerous research centers and specialized institutes, Lund is the strongest research university in Sweden and one of Scandinavia's largest institutions for education and research. The university annually attracts a large number of international students and offers a wide range of courses and programmes taught in English. \n\nThe Faulty of Law is one of Lund University’s four original faculties, dating back to 1666. It is a modern faculty with an international profile, welcoming both international and Swedish students. Education, research and interaction with the surrounding community are the main focus of the Faculty’s work. The connection between the three is particularly apparent in the programmes and courses offered by the university, including the university’s MOOC course in European Business Law. The students get the chance to engross themselves in traditional legal studies, while interacting with both researchers and professionally active lawyers with qualifications and experience from various areas of law.\nThe faculty offers three international Masters: two 2-year Master’s programmes in International Human Rights Law and European Business Law, and a 1-year Master’s in European and International Tax Law. Students from around 40 countries take part in the programmes which offer a unique subject specialization within each field, with highly qualified researchers and professional legal practitioners engaged in the teaching. \n\nThe Master’s programme in European Business Law provides an in-depth understanding of both the practical and the theoretical aspects of business law within the European Union. The programme provides both general and specific knowledge of the European Union legal framework, which is necessary for students intending to work as legal advisors or business decision-makers. The programme is delivered in English and is open to students with at least a three year degree in Law (Bachelor, LL.B, or equivalent) who want to specialise in European economic and business law.\nThe MOOC course in European Business Law is a great course to start with for students intending to apply for the Master’s programme in European Business Law. Even though the MOOC course does not grant credits previous knowledge of the subject is considered upon admission to the master’s programme.

We know that the culture of higher education is different from the culture of the military in meaningful ways, and we also know that one of the keys to excelling in college - especially for student veterans - is learning to navigate these differences successfully, right from the very start.<br /><br />This course aims to help you do just that. First, the course will orient you to the norms and expectations of the college classroom. The quicker you know what is expected of you, the quicker you can start learning. Second, the course will offer you strategies to ease your transition, to help you achieve your academic goals, and to allow you to make the most of your college education.<br /><br />While this course is open to everyone, the content has been tailored specifically for student veterans currently pursuing higher education, active duty servicemembers who aspire to start school or return to school soon, and higher education professionals who work to support student veterans at their schools. If this sounds like you, and if you&rsquo;re ready to learn how to make your transition easier and more successful, then we hope you&rsquo;ll join us.<br /><br />This online curriculum may be used in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, as a start-to finish, self-directed online experience (MOOC). It can also, in its current format, serve as an &ldquo;orientation&rdquo; for other student veteran success programs. We also invite you to utilize this resource as a library/toolkit of academic success strategies, a tool for flipped classroom pedagogy, or a companion text for on-the-ground transition courses.<br /><br />We welcome the opportunity to assist higher education institutions (both 2-year and 4-year), military installation education services officers and transition assistance programs, veteran focused non-profit organizations, and more. To get underway, contact us at the Columbia University Center for Veteran Transition and Integration.<",

In this course, we will look at the potential benefits of circular procurement and how recycling technologies and more efficient ways of collecting and recycling critical raw materials (CRMs) can make your business and production more resource resilient.<br /><br />A good number of the materials found in everyday&nbsp;products are now referred to as \"critical\". This means that there is a risk of failure in their supply&nbsp;and that they are also critical in terms of economic importance. <br /><br />Many metals, for instance, are already critical or could become critical in the near future due to their limited availability and the growing demand for products worldwide. Think of the newest electronic products that contain critical metals such as gallium, which is used in integrated circuits; beryllium, used in electronic and telecommunications equipment and permanent magnets and germanium found in infra-red optics.<br /><br />Innovative product design and reusing, recycling and remanufacturing products can help to deal with a raw materials shortage. But this can only provide an integrated solution if we keep CRMs in the loop through smarter CRM management. The starting point is to identify CRMs in products. It is not always clear what materials are in which products. It is, therefore, necessary to keep all metals in the loop for as long as possible.<br /><br />Scarcity in the supply chain can not only damage businesses but also&nbsp;negatively impact economic development and the environment. For this reason, the course will also discuss environmental issues and electric and electronic waste regulations.<br /><br />This course will be of value to a wide range of professionals working in or interested in this field. These include professionals involved in producing products containing CRMs (such as electronics) as well as local or national government officials tasked with organizing&nbsp;waste management and recycling for these products. Students interested in the field of waste management will also find this course helpful for their studies in electronics, industrial design, and industrial ecology.<br /><br /><em>This course has received funding from the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT). The EIT receives support from the European Union&rsquo;s Horizon2020 research and innovation program.</em></",

This is underlined by the increasing attention on sustainability issues by governments, media, academics and industry.<br /><br />In the context of sustainable development, businesses that are often referred&nbsp;to as part of the problem can be part of the solution. As a consequence, policymakers, industry leaders, society and academics are trying to understand how sustainability affects traditional ways of doing business, and also, how traditional businesses are affected by sustainability. How to develop a sustainable competitive advantage is a key challenge in&nbsp;the agendas of today&rsquo;s global executives.<br /><br />This MBA Primer introduces the topic of sustainability from three perspectives:&nbsp;<strong>corporate sustainability</strong>&nbsp;(core of the module);&nbsp;<strong>business ethics&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>social innovation</strong>.<br /><br />The virtual class will be involved in an engaging debate&nbsp;discussing the different economic, environmental and social perspectives on the topics discussed. At the end of this module, participants will have a comprehensive understanding of sustainability issues, the relevance for policymakers, the role of corporations and the implications for decision-making.</",

You'll hear from experts at Johns Hopkins about their experiences harnessing the power of big data in healthcare, improving EHR adoption, and separating out the hope vs hype when it comes to digital medicine. \n\nWhether you're a nurse, pharmacist, physician, other allied health professional or come from a non-clinical background--you know that Health Informatics skills are in demand. This newly launched 5-course specialization by JohnsHopkins faculty members provides a solid foundation for anyone wanting to become a leader in  one of the hottest fields in healthcare. \n\nAs health informaticians, we need to be very clear in our understanding of the current state (as-is), the future state (to-be) and any unintended consequences that can result from our interventions. Prior to introducing large scale change, we need to assess whether a healthcare organization is truly ready for change. This involves taking into account an organization's current culture and values. Successfully leading change through health informatics also requires strategic planning and careful financial considerations. Proper workflow redesign and a clear change management strategy are of utmost importance when introducing new technologies and in ensuring their successful adoption and proper use. \n\nBy the end of this course, students will become familiar with examples of successful and failed attempts at change in health informatics, and the reasons for each. Students will be armed with tools to help optimize their chances for successfully leading change in their respective organizations. ",

Second, the course will offer you strategies to ease your transition, to help you achieve your academic goals, and to allow you to make the most of your college education.<br /><br />While this course is open to everyone, the content has been tailored specifically for student veterans currently pursuing higher education, active duty servicemembers who aspire to start school or return to school soon, and higher education professionals who work to support student veterans at their schools. If this sounds like you, and if you&rsquo;re ready to learn how to make your transition easier and more successful, then we hope you&rsquo;ll join us.<br /><br />This online curriculum may be used in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, as a start-to finish, self-directed online experience (MOOC). It can also, in its current format, serve as an &ldquo;orientation&rdquo; for other student veteran success programs. We also invite you to utilize this resource as a library/toolkit of academic success strategies, a tool for flipped classroom pedagogy, or a companion text for on-the-ground transition courses.<br /><br />We welcome the opportunity to assist higher education institutions (both 2-year and 4-year), military installation education services officers and transition assistance programs, veteran focused non-profit organizations, and more. To get underway, contact us at the Columbia University Center for Veteran Transition and Integration.<",

No matter which option you choose, the capstone project will examine your skills, including self-awareness, developing quality relationships and trust, resilience, and how making decisions entails a strong sense of responsibility.\n\nFor the personal challenge, you will work on your own question addressing your capacity to grow as a leader. A challenge can be a target objective (starting a company, running a project, designing a product, winning a competition, running a marathon…) you have for yourself which puts into question what you want to achieve and how. The Capstone will help you measure the challenge, establish a process and build the steps to meet your goals.\n\nWhatever personal challenge you choose, specific questions will attest to your capacity to analyze and criticize the the problem which is faced by by yourself.\n\nThe process that will drive the Business plan will follow step by step the relational circuit model developed in MOOC2 “Giving Sense to your Leadership Experience” and MOOC3 “Leading Organizations” with its two phases of Exploration and Projection.\n\nIn the EXPLORATION, you will engage in a first step of holistic perception of the problem using your sensible skills to give a sense of perspective and give voice to you subjective apprehension of the situation as a whole. The second stage of exploration will involve your analytical skills to understand each and every component (elements of data relevant to the challenge) that plays a role in defining the situation. And the third stage of exploration will apply your relational skills where you will make sense and connect your subjective perception with your analysis. You will share the exploration results with peers to receive feedback before your can move on.\n\nThe second phase, the PROJECTION part of your business plan leading to recommendations for the personal challenge at stake. In the projection phase you will first look at what the situation might be when you decenter the problem in time and space. Using benchmark and competitive analysis, you will work on different scenarios for the projected outcomes.

It is also intended to develop the participant's capability to act as an agent for positive change in nonprofit organizations. To this end, you will analyze the leadership and governance effectiveness of a real board of directors in an organization of your own choosing (or, if that is not possible, data gathered from a real board provided by the course instructors). By the end of the Capstone Project, you will have produced a professional consulting report detailing your analysis and recommendations to improve board leadership and governance effectiveness. You will then present it to the board and advise them on implementing change.\n\nTo learn more about this course, please watch the overview video by copying and pasting the following link into your web browser: https://goo.gl/GTWrN2\n\nKeywords: Nonprofit; Nonprofit Sector; Voluntary Sector; Nonprofit Organizations, Non-Governmental Organizations, Volunteer Organizations, Leadership, Management, Governance, Board, Board of Directors, Performance, Effectiveness\n\nCapstone Project Overview:\n\nWeeks 1-3: This period will be spent choosing a board of a nonprofit organization and gathering information using two specially designed tools and resources: The SUNY Open textbook (to download the book copy and paste the following link into your browser: http://tinyurl.com/peolnjb), \"Guidelines for Improving the Effectiveness of Boards of Directors of Nonprofit Organizations\", and The Board Check-Up, online board performance self-assessment tool that can be accessed by copying and pasting this link into your browser: https://www.boardcheckup.com. \n\nWeeks 4-5: In this phase, the information gathered will be analyzed leading to an evaluation of the board's effectiveness in the different dimensions of board effectiveness examined in the Specialization courses. \n\nWeeks 6-8: In the final phase of the Project, the results of the analysis and recommendations for positive change will be brought together a specially prepared consulting report intended for the use of the board of the client organization.",

Nevertheless, it is our hope that much of the course content will still be of value to those in other parts of the world. \n\nTo learn more about this course, please watch the overview video by copying and pasting the following link into your web browser: https://goo.gl/YMg1Qd.\n\nKeywords: Nonprofit; Nonprofit Sector; Voluntary Sector; Nonprofit Organizations, Non-Governmental Organizations, Volunteer Organizations, Leadership, Management, Governance, Board, Board of Directors, Performance, Effectiveness\n\nCourse 1 Overview: \n\nWeek 1: Some of the questions you will explore this week are: What is the nonprofit sector and why does it exist?  What are the unique characteristics of nonprofit organizations? What are the trends and emerging issues facing organizations in the nonprofit sector?\n\nWeek 2: Questions to be explored this week are: What is leadership at the governance level and how is it different from management?  What is good governance and why does it matter? What is a board of directors?\n\nWeek 3: This week's questions: What roles do board members play in nonprofit organizations? Broadly speaking, what are boards responsible for and how do they go about their work? What are some of the issues that challenge the board's ability to go its work?\n\nWeek 4: At this stage, you are asked to review the course content, submit a written assignment (known lightheartedly as a BEAR (Board Effectiveness Readiness Assessment), and take two multiple choice Readiness Assurance Tests (known similarly as RATs). One RAT will assess knowledge and reading comprehension and the other will test application of knowledge within a practical case.  \n\nWeek 5: We will encourage you to discuss the RATs in the discussion forums and take them again should you wish to change any of your answers based on the information exchanged.",

This definition of supervision states the relationship between the managers and their subordinates. This, however, doesn’t explain the manner in which coaches, instructors and mentors motivate people to take up leadership responsibilities for the first time in his/her life. Newly appointed managers find themselves in a new role of coordinating individual efforts in a team’s cause and that requires quickly adjusting to new roles, responsibilities and relationships. To be considered a successful supervisor, they need to develop their skills in administration, technology and interpersonal behavior. This tutorial is designed to help newly-appointed workplace supervisors get a better understanding of their roles and that of others. It contains information on how to work more effectively with apprentices, subordinates, and trainees. ",

You can use this course to help create your own custom preparation plan. It helps you distinguish what you know from what you don't know. And it helps you develop and practice skills required of practitioners who perform this job.\n\nThe course follows the organization of the Exam Guide outline, presenting highest-level concepts, \"touchstones\", for you to determine whether you feel confident about your knowledge of that area and its dependent concepts, or if you want more study. You also will learn about and have the opportunity to practice key job skills, including cognitive skills such as case analysis, identifying technical watchpoints, and developing proposed solutions. These are job skills that are also exam skills. You will also test your basic abilities with Activity Tracking Challenge Labs. And you will have many sample questions similar to those on the exam, including solutions. The end of the course contains an ungraded practice exam quiz, followed by a graded practice exam quiz that simulates the exam-taking experience.",

I appreciate this work and encourage everyone to take a chance to learn from it.\n\nAs a veteran of over 200 MOOCs I must say it is very well organised and the ebook is a really worthwhile resource not only for this course but as a reference book beyond the course. It is obvious that a lot of work and effort went into producing the MOOC.\n\nGreat and thought-provoking content inside. Nicely-made!!\n\nIt is a creative way to address questions raised by the course.\n\nThis is great stuff!!!\n\nThe course content is well-chosen\n\nExcellent video clips!!!\n\nIt was perfect mix!\n\nRealistic view of success!\n\nI found Dr. Chun to be excellent!\n\nThis course was exactly what I needed!!\n\nA very well balanced course in total!\n\nVery clear, easy to follow and an engaging way of presenting complex matter!\n\nThis is a great course. I'm really grateful that you guys have made it and I found it!\n\nEverything was inspirational and many topics were new learning experience for me!\n\nI loved the fact that it included the lives of successful geniuses who practically demonstrated the practical thinking skills for a successful life.\n\nAs an engineer with limited knowledge of philosophy, I found the course very helpful to get in touch with it and get more interested in it.\n\nWe need more such course on Edx! I will hope to see more courses from Dr Jack Chun! I will also request you to at least run twice this course in a year. This year I audited the course. I hope to do this course with a verified certificate soon in next offering of this course.\n\nThis was a very interesting course that has made me to contemplate aspects of my life that require change for me to be successful, as well as giving me an understanding that the acquisition of material wealth will not necessarily equate to a successful life.\n\nThe learning from this course can be directly applied to the real life. Last night, I was watching a mock interview of an IAS officer (in India IAS is a very prestigious government job) and in the interview, they asked some questions by putting you in the situation. In answering those interview question I felt that the knowledge gained from this course helps a lot. I found an application there to solve those interview questions.\n\nThe part I like the most in the course was the interview question because there were 3 different good responses possible. I agree with the ideas of Kant in general, but I think in some instances, like the interview question, I will follow other philosopher's ideas.\n\nThe mix of ancient and modern gave a well-rounded perspective on practical and philosophical approaches to living a successful life. It was interesting to compare and contrast Aristotle, Kant and Mill with the more modern approaches.\n\nLive video and interviews with people such as Jack Ma or Bruce Lee are the key. The micro-movie dramatization was effective.\n\nI can recall information from the cartoons easier. I enjoy reading thoughts posted by other students.\n\nThe practical examples (i.e. cartoons on Kant, Aristotle and Mill) were very helpful to get across the points of their ideas.\n\n",

If you are aiming to rise up in the ranks in your health system or looking to pivot your career in the direction of big data and health IT, this course is made for you. You'll hear from experts at Johns Hopkins about their experiences harnessing the power of big data in healthcare, improving EHR adoption, and separating out the hope vs hype when it comes to digital medicine. \n\nWhether you're a nurse, pharmacist, physician, other allied health professional or come from a non-clinical background--you know that Health Informatics skills are in demand. This newly launched 5-course specialization by JohnsHopkins faculty members provides a solid foundation for anyone wanting to become a leader in  one of the hottest fields in healthcare. \n\nAs health informaticians, we need to be very clear in our understanding of the current state (as-is), the future state (to-be) and any unintended consequences that can result from our interventions. Prior to introducing large scale change, we need to assess whether a healthcare organization is truly ready for change. This involves taking into account an organization's current culture and values. Successfully leading change through health informatics also requires strategic planning and careful financial considerations. Proper workflow redesign and a clear change management strategy are of utmost importance when introducing new technologies and in ensuring their successful adoption and proper use. \n\nBy the end of this course, students will become familiar with examples of successful and failed attempts at change in health informatics, and the reasons for each. Students will be armed with tools to help optimize their chances for successfully leading change in their respective organizations. ",

We know that the culture of higher education is different from the culture of the military in meaningful ways, and we also know that one of the keys to excelling in college - especially for student veterans - is learning to navigate these differences successfully, right from the very start.<br /><br />This course aims to help you do just that. First, the course will orient you to the norms and expectations of the college classroom. The quicker you know what is expected of you, the quicker you can start learning. Second, the course will offer you strategies to ease your transition, to help you achieve your academic goals, and to allow you to make the most of your college education.<br /><br />While this course is open to everyone, the content has been tailored specifically for student veterans currently pursuing higher education, active duty servicemembers who aspire to start school or return to school soon, and higher education professionals who work to support student veterans at their schools. If this sounds like you, and if you&rsquo;re ready to learn how to make your transition easier and more successful, then we hope you&rsquo;ll join us.<br /><br />This online curriculum may be used in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, as a start-to finish, self-directed online experience (MOOC). It can also, in its current format, serve as an &ldquo;orientation&rdquo; for other student veteran success programs. We also invite you to utilize this resource as a library/toolkit of academic success strategies, a tool for flipped classroom pedagogy, or a companion text for on-the-ground transition courses.<br /><br />We welcome the opportunity to assist higher education institutions (both 2-year and 4-year), military installation education services officers and transition assistance programs, veteran focused non-profit organizations, and more. To get underway, contact us at the Columbia University Center for Veteran Transition and Integration.<",

This course will focus on the nature of stressors facing leaders in today’s work environments and how to deal with them. You’ll explore personal resilience – your capacity to withstand and cope with stress – and strategies for self-management, motivation and organisation. You’ll also learn how resilience is impacted by health and social relationships.",

If you are aiming to rise up in the ranks in your health system or looking to pivot your career in the direction of big data and health IT, this course is made for you. You'll hear from experts at Johns Hopkins about their experiences harnessing the power of big data in healthcare, improving EHR adoption, and separating out the hope vs hype when it comes to digital medicine. \n\nWhether you're a nurse, pharmacist, physician, other allied health professional or come from a non-clinical background--you know that Health Informatics skills are in demand. This newly launched 5-course specialization by JohnsHopkins faculty members provides a solid foundation for anyone wanting to become a leader in  one of the hottest fields in healthcare. \n\nAs health informaticians, we need to be very clear in our understanding of the current state (as-is), the future state (to-be) and any unintended consequences that can result from our interventions. Prior to introducing large scale change, we need to assess whether a healthcare organization is truly ready for change. This involves taking into account an organization's current culture and values. Successfully leading change through health informatics also requires strategic planning and careful financial considerations. Proper workflow redesign and a clear change management strategy are of utmost importance when introducing new technologies and in ensuring their successful adoption and proper use. \n\nBy the end of this course, students will become familiar with examples of successful and failed attempts at change in health informatics, and the reasons for each. Students will be armed with tools to help optimize their chances for successfully leading change in their respective organizations. ",

We know that the culture of higher education is different from the culture of the military in meaningful ways, and we also know that one of the keys to excelling in college - especially for student veterans - is learning to navigate these differences successfully, right from the very start.<br /><br />This course aims to help you do just that. First, the course will orient you to the norms and expectations of the college classroom. The quicker you know what is expected of you, the quicker you can start learning. Second, the course will offer you strategies to ease your transition, to help you achieve your academic goals, and to allow you to make the most of your college education.<br /><br />While this course is open to everyone, the content has been tailored specifically for student veterans currently pursuing higher education, active duty servicemembers who aspire to start school or return to school soon, and higher education professionals who work to support student veterans at their schools. If this sounds like you, and if you&rsquo;re ready to learn how to make your transition easier and more successful, then we hope you&rsquo;ll join us.<br /><br />This online curriculum may be used in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, as a start-to finish, self-directed online experience (MOOC). It can also, in its current format, serve as an &ldquo;orientation&rdquo; for other student veteran success programs. We also invite you to utilize this resource as a library/toolkit of academic success strategies, a tool for flipped classroom pedagogy, or a companion text for on-the-ground transition courses.<br /><br />We welcome the opportunity to assist higher education institutions (both 2-year and 4-year), military installation education services officers and transition assistance programs, veteran focused non-profit organizations, and more. To get underway, contact us at the Columbia University Center for Veteran Transition and Integration.<",

And that is why we all need design thinking. At every level in every kind of organization, design thinking provides the tools you need to become an innovative thinker and uncover creative opportunities that are there – you're just not seeing them yet.\n\nIn this course, we provide an overview of design thinking and work with a model containing four key questions and several tools to help you understand design thinking as a problem solving approach. We also look at several stories from different organizations that used design thinking to uncover compelling solutions.",

I appreciate this work and encourage everyone to take a chance to learn from it.\n\nAs a veteran of over 200 MOOCs I must say it is very well organised and the ebook is a really worthwhile resource not only for this course but as a reference book beyond the course. It is obvious that a lot of work and effort went into producing the MOOC.\n\nGreat and thought-provoking content inside. Nicely-made!!\n\nIt is a creative way to address questions raised by the course.\n\nThis is great stuff!!!\n\nThe course content is well-chosen\n\nExcellent video clips!!!\n\nIt was perfect mix!\n\nRealistic view of success!\n\nI found Dr. Chun to be excellent!\n\nThis course was exactly what I needed!!\n\nA very well balanced course in total!\n\nVery clear, easy to follow and an engaging way of presenting complex matter!\n\nThis is a great course. I'm really grateful that you guys have made it and I found it!\n\nEverything was inspirational and many topics were new learning experience for me!\n\nI loved the fact that it included the lives of successful geniuses who practically demonstrated the practical thinking skills for a successful life.\n\nAs an engineer with limited knowledge of philosophy, I found the course very helpful to get in touch with it and get more interested in it.\n\nWe need more such course on Edx! I will hope to see more courses from Dr Jack Chun! I will also request you to at least run twice this course in a year. This year I audited the course. I hope to do this course with a verified certificate soon in next offering of this course.\n\nThis was a very interesting course that has made me to contemplate aspects of my life that require change for me to be successful, as well as giving me an understanding that the acquisition of material wealth will not necessarily equate to a successful life.\n\nThe learning from this course can be directly applied to the real life. Last night, I was watching a mock interview of an IAS officer (in India IAS is a very prestigious government job) and in the interview, they asked some questions by putting you in the situation. In answering those interview question I felt that the knowledge gained from this course helps a lot. I found an application there to solve those interview questions.\n\nThe part I like the most in the course was the interview question because there were 3 different good responses possible. I agree with the ideas of Kant in general, but I think in some instances, like the interview question, I will follow other philosopher's ideas.\n\nThe mix of ancient and modern gave a well-rounded perspective on practical and philosophical approaches to living a successful life. It was interesting to compare and contrast Aristotle, Kant and Mill with the more modern approaches.\n\nLive video and interviews with people such as Jack Ma or Bruce Lee are the key. The micro-movie dramatization was effective.\n\nI can recall information from the cartoons easier. I enjoy reading thoughts posted by other students.\n\nThe practical examples (i.e. cartoons on Kant, Aristotle and Mill) were very helpful to get across the points of their ideas.\n\n",

It can sometimes be challenging to step back and reflect in an environment which is fast paced or when you are required to assimilate large amounts of information. Making sense of or communicating new ideas in an innovative and engaging way, approaching problems from fresh angles, and producing novel solutions are all traits which are highly sought after by employers.\n\nThis course will equip you with a ‘tool-box’, introducing you to a selection of behaviours and techniques that will augment your innate creativity. Some of the tools are suited to use on your own and others work well for a group, enabling you to leverage the power of several minds.  You can pick and choose which of these tools or techniques suit your needs and interests, focusing on some or all of the selected approaches and in the order that fits best for you.\n\nThe practical approach of this course enables you to acquire an essential skill-set for generating ideas, with plenty of:\n- Fun e-tivities and exercises;\n- Practical lectures and tips;\n- Video representations of the techniques in action.\n\nBy the end of this course you should be able to:\n- Pick a type of brainstorming you think will be useful to apply to a challenge\n- Use alphabet brainstorming in tackling a challenge\n- Use grid brainstorming in tackling a challenge\n- Use a morphological chart to synthesise a solution to a challenge\n- Use the TRIZ contradiction matrix to identify recommended inventive principles\n- Apply SCAMPER to a range of challenges\n\nThe greatest innovators aren’t necessarily the people who have the most original idea. Often, they are people- or teams- that have harnessed their creativity to develop a new perspective or more effective way of communicating an idea. You can train your imagination to seize opportunities, break away from routine and habit, and tap into your natural creativity.\n\nJoin this course and our community of practitioners in CREATIVITY!",

For most people and organizations, the actual problem solving phase is still very much a random process usually consisting of brain storming, trial-and-error and guesswork. Using structured and systematic innovation methodology allows for solving difficult problems in a shorter amount of time and with better results. Systematic innovation is a cornerstone for innovation strategies&nbsp;in some large multinational companies. <br /><br />The Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ) has gained a reputation for systematic problem analysis, problem-solving and system forecasting. TRIZ was developed in Russia based on decades of research. However, TRIZ is considered to be underutilized and not very well known internationally, especially within the life science sector. <br /><br />The course targets students, professionals and citizens with interest in innovation and entrepreneurship. Innovation essentials in the life science sector context will be presented, as well as TRIZ methods and principles. The aim of this course is to learn when, and how, to use all the tools in the &ldquo;tool box&rdquo;. Case studies will be shared, reviewed and discussed. <br /><br />Participants who complete and pass the course will be able to use structured and systematic innovation methodology in their projects. Many may be highly motivated to continue developing their skills in additional courses to gain deeper knowledge and potentially gain certification.<br /><br />This course is offered in collaboration with <a title=\"Research Institutes of Sweden\" href=\"https://www.ri.se/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">RISE</a>, <a title=\"Oxford Academic Health Science\" href=\"https://www.oxfordahsn.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Oxford AHSN</a> and <a title=\"EIT Health\" href=\"https://www.eithealth.eu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">EIT Health</a>.</",

This tutorial is intended for InDesign users of all levels of experience. Beginners will find valuable information on how to set up the right document layout and choosing the best colors. Intermediate users will find information on adjusting transparency, inserting QR codes and working with objects and layers. Advanced users will find handy information on creating eBooks, preflighting and packaging documents, and also transitioning workflows between InDesign and popular software such as Word, Photoshop, and Illustrator.

Вы сможете понять и применить приведенные в курсе примеры независимо от того, разрабатываете ли вы софт или совсем не связаны с ИТ-индустрией. \n\nОба преподавателя курса имеют уникальный практический опыт. Они были разработчиками, менеджерами проектов, руководителями разработки и т.п. А за последние годы — в роли консультантов и тренеров — они помогли десяткам организаций повысить свою эффективность за счет Agile. Подобный опыт на русском языке до сих пор можно было узнать только на дорогостоящих очных тренингах и конференциях.\n\nКурс включает не только видео и тесты. Наибольшую пользу вы получите, выполняя разнообразные задания: например, создавая свою скрам-доску или анализируя ситуации из вашей работы с точки зрения Agile-принципов.\n\nБольшое внимание в курсе уделяется практическим вопросам типа «Как “продать” Agile руководству и команде?», а также путям вашего профессионального и карьерного роста в гибких организациях.\n\nКурс полезен всем, кто хочет применять Agile и Scrum в своей работе, – от программиста до технического директора. Но максимальный объем знаний и навыков от курса получат тимлиды, менеджеры проектов и другие руководители: для них в курсе предусмотрены дополнительные задания, например, «Устранение пороков вашей команды», «Чек-лист правильного Скрама».",

To get the most out of this course, you should first take our first course entitled \"Sensors and Sensor Circuits\", our second course entitled \"Motor and Motor Control Circuits\", and our third course entitled \"Pressure, Force, Motion, and Humidity Sensors\". Our first course gives you a tutorial on how to use the hardware and software development kit we have chosen for the lab exercises. Our second and third courses give you three hands-on lab experiments using the kit. This third course assumes that you already know how to use the kit.\n\nYou will learn about sensor signal characterization and manufacturing techniques and how to optimize the accuracy of sensors. You will also learn about more advanced sensors, proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control, and how this method is used to give you a closed loop sensor feedback system.\n\nAfter taking this course, you will be able to:\n●\tUnderstand how sensor manufacturers characterize and calibrate their sensors.\n●\tTune a PID control loop and access the PID control function of the Cypress PSoC development kit for a motor control application.  \n●\tUnderstand manufacturing methods used to build electro-mechanical and micro-machined sensors.\n\nYou will need to buy the following components to do the two course projects based on the videos in this module. Note that if you have already purchased the PSOC 5LP PROTOTYPING KIT, you do not need to buy it again. \n\nThese parts may be purchased off the Digikey web site, www. Digikey.com. Or, you may obtain the specs from the site, and purchase them elsewhere. All are quantity one except for N107-ND where you need three, and 493-15371-ND where you need two. \n\n428-3390-ND\nP14355-ND\nFQU13N10LTU-ND\nN107-ND\n1N5393-E3/54GICT-ND \nRNF14FTD1K00CT-ND \nP0.62W-1BK-ND\n493-15371-ND",

            "long_description": "This course focuses on the phenomenon of ferromagnetism. Ferromagnetism is a magnetically ordered state of matter in which atomic magnetic moments are parallel to each other, so that the matter has a spontaneous magnetization. Owing to ferromagnetism, some materials (such as iron) can be attracted by magnets or become the permanent magnets themselves. The phenomenon of ferromagnetism plays an important role in modern technologies. It is a physical basis for the creation of a variety of electrical and electronic devices, such as transformers, electromagnets, magnetic storage devices, hard drives, spintronic devices, etc. However, in the absence of external magnetic field ferromagnetism does not occur at any temperature. It occurs only below some critical temperature, which is called the Curie temperature. For different ferromagnetic materials, the Curie temperature has its own value. It should be noted that the phenomenon of ferromagnetism arises due to the exchange interaction, which tends to set the magnetic moments of neighboring atoms or ions parallel to each other. The exchange interaction is a purely quantum effect, which has no analogue in classical physics. In this course we shall try to understand the microscopic origin of ferromagnetism, to learn about its experimental appearing, magnetizing field, magnetic anisotropy, and quantum mechanical effect. We try to build a quantum mechanical theory of ferromagnetism. The course is aimed to graduate students wishing to improve their level in the field of theoretical physics.",
