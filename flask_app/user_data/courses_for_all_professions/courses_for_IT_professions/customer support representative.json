To make learning Python easy, we have developed a new browser-based programming environment that makes developing interactive applications in Python simple. These applications will involve windows whose contents are graphical and respond to buttons, the keyboard and the mouse.\n\nIn part 2 of this course, we will introduce more elements of programming (such as list, dictionaries, and loops) and then use these elements to create games such as Blackjack.  Part 1 of this class will culminate in building a version of the classic arcade game \"Asteroids\".  Upon completing this course, you will be able to write small, but interesting Python programs.

Functions let you encapsulate complex reasoning into reusable chunks of code. Error handling lets you intelligently recover from anticipated and unanticipated glitches.<br /><br />By the end of this course, you'll be able to write complex programs in Python that perform useful reasoning. For example, you could write a program that calculates your weight on other planets, calculates the standard deviation of a series of numbers, or checks for the validity of an incoming password.<br /><br />Structurally, the course is comprised of several parts.

            "long_description": "In this 2-hour long project-based course, you will learn how to implement Logistic Regression using Python and Numpy. Logistic Regression is an important fundamental concept if you want break into Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Even though popular machine learning frameworks have implementations of logistic regression available, it's still a great idea to learn to implement it on your own to understand the mechanics of optimization algorithm, and the training and validation process.\n\nSince this is a practical, project-based course, you will need to have a theoretical understanding of logistic regression, and gradient descent. We will focus on the practical aspect of implementing logistic regression with gradient descent, but not on the theoretical aspect.\n\nBy the end of this course, you would create and train a logistic model that will be able to predict if a given image is of hand-written digit zero or of hand-written digit one. The model will be able to distinguish between images or 0s and 1s, and it will do that with a very high accuracy. Not only that, your implementation of the logistic model will also be able to solve any generic binary classiﬁcation problem. You will still have to train model instances on speciﬁc datasets of course, but you won’t have to change the implementation and it will be re-usable. The dataset for images of hand written digits comes from the popular MNIST dataset. This data set consists of images for the 10 hand-written digits (from 0 to 9), but since we are implementing logistic regression, and are looking to solve binary classiﬁcation problems - we will work with examples of hand written zeros, and hand written ones and we will ignore examples of rest of the digits.\n\nThis course runs on Coursera's hands-on project platform called Rhyme. On Rhyme, you do projects in a hands-on manner in your browser. You will get instant access to pre-configured cloud desktops containing all of the software and data you need for the project. Everything is already set up directly in your internet browser so you can just focus on learning. For this project, you’ll get instant access to a cloud desktop with Python, Jupyter, and Tensorflow pre-installed.\n\nNotes:\n-  You will be able to access the cloud desktop 5 times. However, you will be able to access instructions videos as many times as you want.\n- This course works best for learners who are based in the North America region.

Topics covered include financial goal setting, saving and investing, budgeting, financial risk, borrowing and credit. Because financial planning is such a personal topic, you will be encouraged to define your own financial goals and objectives while we discuss concepts and provide tools which can be applied in helping you reach those goals.\n\nWithin each module, you will view a combination of traditional lecture style videos along with video vignettes that introduce financial topics for discussion among participants. The video vignettes provide a unique and exciting component to this course. Each vignette introduces a real-world scenario where financial decisions must be made and financial planning concepts can be applied. You will be challenged to think critically about each scenario and decide how you might come to a resolution if ever faced with a similar situation.\n\nFinally, the course also includes material throughout which is focused on career opportunities in financial planning, including video interviews with actual CFP® professionals and other professionals working in this exciting and growing career area.

This newly launched 5-course specialization by JohnsHopkins faculty members provides a solid foundation for anyone wanting to become a leader in  one of the hottest fields in healthcare. \n\nAs health informaticians, we need to be very clear in our understanding of the current state (as-is), the future state (to-be) and any unintended consequences that can result from our interventions. Prior to introducing large scale change, we need to assess whether a healthcare organization is truly ready for change. This involves taking into account an organization's current culture and values. Successfully leading change through health informatics also requires strategic planning and careful financial considerations. Proper workflow redesign and a clear change management strategy are of utmost importance when introducing new technologies and in ensuring their successful adoption and proper use. \n\nBy the end of this course, students will become familiar with examples of successful and failed attempts at change in health informatics, and the reasons for each.

            "long_description": "Do you want to know how robots work?  Are you interested in robotics as a career?  Are you willing to invest the effort to learn fundamental mathematical modeling techniques that are used in all subfields of robotics?\n\nIf so, then the \"Modern Robotics:  Mechanics, Planning, and Control\" specialization may be for you.  This specialization, consisting of six short courses, is serious preparation for serious students who hope to work in the field of robotics or to undertake advanced study.  It is not a sampler.\n\nIn Course 4 of the specialization, Robot Motion Planning and Control, you will learn key concepts of robot motion generation:  planning a motion for a robot in the presence of obstacles, and real-time feedback control to track the planned motion.  Chapter 10, Motion Planning, of the \"Modern Robotics\" textbook covers foundational material like C-space obstacles, graphs and trees, and graph search, as well as classical and modern motion planning techniques, such as grid-based motion planning, randomized sampling-based planners, and virtual potential fields.  Chapter 11, Robot Control, covers motion control, force control, and hybrid motion-force control.\n\nThis course follows the textbook \"Modern Robotics:  Mechanics, Planning, and Control\" (Lynch and Park, Cambridge University Press 2017).  You can purchase the book or use the free preprint pdf.  You will build on a library of robotics software in the language of your choice (among Python, Mathematica, and MATLAB) and use the free cross-platform robot simulator V-REP, which allows you to work with state-of-the-art robots in the comfort of your own home and with zero financial investment.",

Over these 9 weeks we will cover a number of theories, cases and applications in the field of communication science. We will start with the foundational concepts of communication theory, defining what the theory is and going through a number of approaches to communication itself.\n\nEach week you will have a test to check on your progress and understanding. We also have a final text in the end of the course and a little bit of writing. As Oscar Wilde said, if you cannot write, you cannot think. If you cannot think, others will do thinking for you. So we find writing and reflecting pretty important for our classes. Along the course we provide you with in-class materials: lecture presentations,  articles and additional readings. If you really want to get into the topic, don’t avoid this extra work.\n\nAlthough a substantial part of this course is theory-based, communication theory has a very practical application. Communication is an underlying process which creates and develops relationships, communities, societies. We communicative on a daily basis via a variety of means and channels. In our globalised and increasingly interconnected world, communication skills are essential in both the personal and professional spheres. It is our goal to leave you with a contextualisation and conceptualisation of communicative processes that will poise you to hone your own communicative skills — in other words, to put theory into practice.\n\nDo you have technical problems?

The portfolio includes three individual elements—a written memo, a slide deck, and a presentation—integrated around a single topic. We provide the elements for a basic capstone, but we also invite our learners to create their own project if they so choose. This self-designed \"Challenge Capstone\" allows learners to engage meaningfully in their world by choosing a project relevant to their current job or by volunteering to write, design, and speak for a social organization of their choice.\n \nBy successfully undertaking the Capstone, learners will accomplish three main goals: 1. They will hone their writing, design, and speaking skills and build a portfolio for a job search and/or professional application; 2. They will shape these skills into a unique brand identity; and, if they choose, 3. They will undertake a transformative effect in the world around them. Ultimately, the importance of Capstone portfolio is greater than the sum of its individual parts. Its true goal lies in each student’s personal transformation and expression of their best selves.

            "long_description": " How can we improve the innovation process without sacrificing creativity? For most people and organizations, the actual problem solving phase is still very much a random process usually consisting of brain storming, trial-and-error and guesswork. Using structured and systematic innovation methodology allows for solving difficult problems in a shorter amount of time and with better results. Systematic innovation is a cornerstone for innovation strategies&nbsp;in some large multinational companies. <br /><br />The Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ) has gained a reputation for systematic problem analysis, problem-solving and system forecasting. TRIZ was developed in Russia based on decades of research. However, TRIZ is considered to be underutilized and not very well known internationally, especially within the life science sector. <br /><br />The course targets students, professionals and citizens with interest in innovation and entrepreneurship. Innovation essentials in the life science sector context will be presented, as well as TRIZ methods and principles. The aim of this course is to learn when, and how, to use all the tools in the &ldquo;tool box&rdquo;. Case studies will be shared, reviewed and discussed. <br /><br />Participants who complete and pass the course will be able to use structured and systematic innovation methodology in their projects. Many may be highly motivated to continue developing their skills in additional courses to gain deeper knowledge and potentially gain certification.<br /><br />This course is offered in collaboration with <a title=\"Research Institutes of Sweden\" href=\"https://www.ri.se/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">RISE</a>, <a title=\"Oxford Academic Health Science\" href=\"https://www.oxfordahsn.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Oxford AHSN</a> and <a title=\"EIT Health\" href=\"https://www.eithealth.eu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">EIT Health</a>.</",

We will then use these building blocks to construct confidence intervals.\n\nTopics covered include:\n•\tIntroducing the t-distribution, the T.DIST and T.INV excel functions\n•\tConceptual understanding of a Confidence Interval\n•\tThe z-statistic and the t-statistic\n•\tConstructing a Confidence Interval using z-statistic and t-statistic \n\n\nWEEK 2\nModule 2: Confidence Interval - Applications\nThis module presents various business applications of the confidence interval including an application where we use the confidence interval to calculate an appropriate sample size. We also introduce with an application, the confidence interval for a population proportion. Towards the close of module we start introducing the concept of Hypothesis Testing.\n\nTopics covered include:\n•\tApplications of Confidence Interval\n•\tConfidence Interval for a Population Proportion\n•\tSample Size Calculation\n•\tHypothesis Testing, An Introduction\n\n\nWEEK 3\nModule 3: Hypothesis Testing\nThis module introduces Hypothesis Testing. You get to understand the logic behind hypothesis tests. The four steps for conducting a hypothesis test are introduced and you get to apply them for hypothesis tests for a population mean as well as population proportion. You will understand the difference between single tail hypothesis tests and two tail hypothesis tests and also the Type I and Type II errors associated with hypothesis tests and ways to reduce such errors. \n\nTopics covered include:\n•\tThe Logic of Hypothesis Testing\n•\tThe Four Steps for conducting a Hypothesis Test\n•\tSingle Tail and Two Tail Hypothesis Tests\n•\tGuidelines, Formulas and an Application of Hypothesis Test\n•\tHypothesis Test for a Population Proportion\n•\tType I and Type II Errors in a Hypothesis \n\n\nWEEK 4\nModule 4: Hypothesis Test - Differences in Mean\nIn this module, you'll apply Hypothesis Tests to test the difference between two different data, such hypothesis tests are called difference in means tests. We will introduce the three kinds of difference in means test and apply them to various business applications. We will also introduce the Excel dialog box to conduct such hypothesis tests.\n\nTopics covered include:\n•\tIntroducing the Difference-In-Means Hypothesis Test\n•\tApplications of the Difference-In-Means Hypothesis Test\n•\tThe Equal & Unequal Variance Assumption and the Paired t-test for difference in means.\n•\tSome more applications",

By hearing, seeing, and writing yourself, you will learn about classical, modern, ancient, pop, jazz, and folk styles.\n\nThrough lectures, relevant examples, and numerous practice assignments, we will examine fundamental aspects of melody. We will move into working with two voices and counterpoint, and finally to three voices and the beginnings of harmonic function.\n\nThis is an intermediate-level course for musicians and composers who already have some understanding of music theory through previous study. If you are a musician or composer looking to build a deeper understanding of music theory for composing, performing, or improvisation, you have come to the right place.

The course also examines other legal areas such as Tax law, Environmental law and Private International law, and how they tie in to doing business in Europe.\n\nAt the end of this course, you will have a basic understanding of how to:\n\n· Understand the relevant regulations governing the internal European Union market\n\n· Establish and run a company within the European Union\n\n· Employ staff and recognize workers’ rights and obligations\n\n· Comply with tax regulations and environmental standards\n\n· Set up agreements and resolve cross-border disputes\n\n· Successfully analyse EU case law and draft case reports\n\n\nAbout the Series\n\nThe Lund series in European Business Law ranges from considering the basic structures and principles of the European Union to focusing on specialized areas of European Union law. The first course, Understanding the Fundamentals, examines the core structures and principles of the European Union. The third and final course, Competing in Europe, goes into depth concerning how to compete on the internal market and protect your brand, product or invention. All three courses can be taken independently or in sequence depending on your needs and preferences.\n\nTo keep up to speed on the course series, visit our Facebook page at:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/eblmooc/\n\n\nSyllabus and Format\n\nEach course consists of a number of modules where one module represents about one week of work.

The University has 47 700 students and 7 500 staff based in Lund, Sweden. Lund University unites tradition with a modern, dynamic, and highly international profile. With eight different faculties and numerous research centers and specialized institutes, Lund is the strongest research university in Sweden and one of Scandinavia's largest institutions for education and research. The university annually attracts a large number of international students and offers a wide range of courses and programmes taught in English. \n\nThe Faulty of Law is one of Lund University’s four original faculties, dating back to 1666. It is a modern faculty with an international profile, welcoming both international and Swedish students. Education, research and interaction with the surrounding community are the main focus of the Faculty’s work. The connection between the three is particularly apparent in the programmes and courses offered by the university, including the university’s MOOC course in European Business Law. The students get the chance to engross themselves in traditional legal studies, while interacting with both researchers and professionally active lawyers with qualifications and experience from various areas of law.\nThe faculty offers three international Masters: two 2-year Master’s programmes in International Human Rights Law and European Business Law, and a 1-year Master’s in European and International Tax Law. Students from around 40 countries take part in the programmes which offer a unique subject specialization within each field, with highly qualified researchers and professional legal practitioners engaged in the teaching. \n\nThe Master’s programme in European Business Law provides an in-depth understanding of both the practical and the theoretical aspects of business law within the European Union. The programme provides both general and specific knowledge of the European Union legal framework, which is necessary for students intending to work as legal advisors or business decision-makers. The programme is delivered in English and is open to students with at least a three year degree in Law (Bachelor, LL.B, or equivalent) who want to specialise in European economic and business law.\nThe MOOC course in European Business Law is a great course to start with for students intending to apply for the Master’s programme in European Business Law. Even though the MOOC course does not grant credits previous knowledge of the subject is considered upon admission to the master’s programme.

We know that the culture of higher education is different from the culture of the military in meaningful ways, and we also know that one of the keys to excelling in college - especially for student veterans - is learning to navigate these differences successfully, right from the very start.<br /><br />This course aims to help you do just that. First, the course will orient you to the norms and expectations of the college classroom. The quicker you know what is expected of you, the quicker you can start learning. Second, the course will offer you strategies to ease your transition, to help you achieve your academic goals, and to allow you to make the most of your college education.<br /><br />While this course is open to everyone, the content has been tailored specifically for student veterans currently pursuing higher education, active duty servicemembers who aspire to start school or return to school soon, and higher education professionals who work to support student veterans at their schools. If this sounds like you, and if you&rsquo;re ready to learn how to make your transition easier and more successful, then we hope you&rsquo;ll join us.<br /><br />This online curriculum may be used in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, as a start-to finish, self-directed online experience (MOOC). It can also, in its current format, serve as an &ldquo;orientation&rdquo; for other student veteran success programs. We also invite you to utilize this resource as a library/toolkit of academic success strategies, a tool for flipped classroom pedagogy, or a companion text for on-the-ground transition courses.<br /><br />We welcome the opportunity to assist higher education institutions (both 2-year and 4-year), military installation education services officers and transition assistance programs, veteran focused non-profit organizations, and more. To get underway, contact us at the Columbia University Center for Veteran Transition and Integration.<",

In this course, we will look at the potential benefits of circular procurement and how recycling technologies and more efficient ways of collecting and recycling critical raw materials (CRMs) can make your business and production more resource resilient.<br /><br />A good number of the materials found in everyday&nbsp;products are now referred to as \"critical\". This means that there is a risk of failure in their supply&nbsp;and that they are also critical in terms of economic importance. <br /><br />Many metals, for instance, are already critical or could become critical in the near future due to their limited availability and the growing demand for products worldwide. Think of the newest electronic products that contain critical metals such as gallium, which is used in integrated circuits; beryllium, used in electronic and telecommunications equipment and permanent magnets and germanium found in infra-red optics.<br /><br />Innovative product design and reusing, recycling and remanufacturing products can help to deal with a raw materials shortage. But this can only provide an integrated solution if we keep CRMs in the loop through smarter CRM management. The starting point is to identify CRMs in products. It is not always clear what materials are in which products. It is, therefore, necessary to keep all metals in the loop for as long as possible.<br /><br />Scarcity in the supply chain can not only damage businesses but also&nbsp;negatively impact economic development and the environment. For this reason, the course will also discuss environmental issues and electric and electronic waste regulations.<br /><br />This course will be of value to a wide range of professionals working in or interested in this field. These include professionals involved in producing products containing CRMs (such as electronics) as well as local or national government officials tasked with organizing&nbsp;waste management and recycling for these products. Students interested in the field of waste management will also find this course helpful for their studies in electronics, industrial design, and industrial ecology.<br /><br /><em>This course has received funding from the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT). The EIT receives support from the European Union&rsquo;s Horizon2020 research and innovation program.</em></",

You’ll further study delays and reverbs before moving to advanced concepts in audio editing, synthetic processing, automatic & graphic pitch correction, time compression, time expansion, flex and elastic audio. \n\nThrough analysis and/or hands on projects that the students will post for peer review, the student will gain an understanding of the many choices available to modern record producers as they record and mix with a modern tool set. You’ll see, in action, the Vocoder, Auto-Tune, Melodyne, Elastic Audio, Flex Time, VocAlign, tempo based editing and a host of other file modification protocols that are readily available on most Digital Audio Workstations. This course gives students a thorough look at the expanded choices that have risen in the art of vocal production as a result of these modern tools.\n\nThe goal of the course is to help interested novices understand the recordings they are listening to, performers find an expanded language for their recorded voices and for vocal producers to be able to create musically artistic visualizations using singers as their paintbrushes.",

If you are aiming to rise up in the ranks in your health system or looking to pivot your career in the direction of big data and health IT, this course is made for you. You'll hear from experts at Johns Hopkins about their experiences harnessing the power of big data in healthcare, improving EHR adoption, and separating out the hope vs hype when it comes to digital medicine. \n\nWhether you're a nurse, pharmacist, physician, other allied health professional or come from a non-clinical background--you know that Health Informatics skills are in demand. This newly launched 5-course specialization by JohnsHopkins faculty members provides a solid foundation for anyone wanting to become a leader in  one of the hottest fields in healthcare. \n\nAs health informaticians, we need to be very clear in our understanding of the current state (as-is), the future state (to-be) and any unintended consequences that can result from our interventions. Prior to introducing large scale change, we need to assess whether a healthcare organization is truly ready for change. This involves taking into account an organization's current culture and values. Successfully leading change through health informatics also requires strategic planning and careful financial considerations. Proper workflow redesign and a clear change management strategy are of utmost importance when introducing new technologies and in ensuring their successful adoption and proper use. \n\nBy the end of this course, students will become familiar with examples of successful and failed attempts at change in health informatics, and the reasons for each. Students will be armed with tools to help optimize their chances for successfully leading change in their respective organizations. ",

First, the course will orient you to the norms and expectations of the college classroom. The quicker you know what is expected of you, the quicker you can start learning. Second, the course will offer you strategies to ease your transition, to help you achieve your academic goals, and to allow you to make the most of your college education.<br /><br />While this course is open to everyone, the content has been tailored specifically for student veterans currently pursuing higher education, active duty servicemembers who aspire to start school or return to school soon, and higher education professionals who work to support student veterans at their schools. If this sounds like you, and if you&rsquo;re ready to learn how to make your transition easier and more successful, then we hope you&rsquo;ll join us.<br /><br />This online curriculum may be used in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, as a start-to finish, self-directed online experience (MOOC). It can also, in its current format, serve as an &ldquo;orientation&rdquo; for other student veteran success programs. We also invite you to utilize this resource as a library/toolkit of academic success strategies, a tool for flipped classroom pedagogy, or a companion text for on-the-ground transition courses.<br /><br />We welcome the opportunity to assist higher education institutions (both 2-year and 4-year), military installation education services officers and transition assistance programs, veteran focused non-profit organizations, and more. To get underway, contact us at the Columbia University Center for Veteran Transition and Integration.<",

No matter which option you choose, the capstone project will examine your skills, including self-awareness, developing quality relationships and trust, resilience, and how making decisions entails a strong sense of responsibility.\n\nFor the personal challenge, you will work on your own question addressing your capacity to grow as a leader. A challenge can be a target objective (starting a company, running a project, designing a product, winning a competition, running a marathon…) you have for yourself which puts into question what you want to achieve and how. The Capstone will help you measure the challenge, establish a process and build the steps to meet your goals.\n\nWhatever personal challenge you choose, specific questions will attest to your capacity to analyze and criticize the the problem which is faced by by yourself.\n\nThe process that will drive the Business plan will follow step by step the relational circuit model developed in MOOC2 “Giving Sense to your Leadership Experience” and MOOC3 “Leading Organizations” with its two phases of Exploration and Projection.\n\nIn the EXPLORATION, you will engage in a first step of holistic perception of the problem using your sensible skills to give a sense of perspective and give voice to you subjective apprehension of the situation as a whole. The second stage of exploration will involve your analytical skills to understand each and every component (elements of data relevant to the challenge) that plays a role in defining the situation. And the third stage of exploration will apply your relational skills where you will make sense and connect your subjective perception with your analysis. You will share the exploration results with peers to receive feedback before your can move on.\n\nThe second phase, the PROJECTION part of your business plan leading to recommendations for the personal challenge at stake. In the projection phase you will first look at what the situation might be when you decenter the problem in time and space. Using benchmark and competitive analysis, you will work on different scenarios for the projected outcomes.

It is also intended to develop the participant's capability to act as an agent for positive change in nonprofit organizations. To this end, you will analyze the leadership and governance effectiveness of a real board of directors in an organization of your own choosing (or, if that is not possible, data gathered from a real board provided by the course instructors). By the end of the Capstone Project, you will have produced a professional consulting report detailing your analysis and recommendations to improve board leadership and governance effectiveness. You will then present it to the board and advise them on implementing change.\n\nTo learn more about this course, please watch the overview video by copying and pasting the following link into your web browser: https://goo.gl/GTWrN2\n\nKeywords: Nonprofit; Nonprofit Sector; Voluntary Sector; Nonprofit Organizations, Non-Governmental Organizations, Volunteer Organizations, Leadership, Management, Governance, Board, Board of Directors, Performance, Effectiveness\n\nCapstone Project Overview:\n\nWeeks 1-3: This period will be spent choosing a board of a nonprofit organization and gathering information using two specially designed tools and resources: The SUNY Open textbook (to download the book copy and paste the following link into your browser: http://tinyurl.com/peolnjb), \"Guidelines for Improving the Effectiveness of Boards of Directors of Nonprofit Organizations\", and The Board Check-Up, online board performance self-assessment tool that can be accessed by copying and pasting this link into your browser: https://www.boardcheckup.com. \n\nWeeks 4-5: In this phase, the information gathered will be analyzed leading to an evaluation of the board's effectiveness in the different dimensions of board effectiveness examined in the Specialization courses. \n\nWeeks 6-8: In the final phase of the Project, the results of the analysis and recommendations for positive change will be brought together a specially prepared consulting report intended for the use of the board of the client organization.",

Nevertheless, it is our hope that much of the course content will still be of value to those in other parts of the world. \n\nTo learn more about this course, please watch the overview video by copying and pasting the following link into your web browser: https://goo.gl/YMg1Qd.\n\nKeywords: Nonprofit; Nonprofit Sector; Voluntary Sector; Nonprofit Organizations, Non-Governmental Organizations, Volunteer Organizations, Leadership, Management, Governance, Board, Board of Directors, Performance, Effectiveness\n\nCourse 1 Overview: \n\nWeek 1: Some of the questions you will explore this week are: What is the nonprofit sector and why does it exist?  What are the unique characteristics of nonprofit organizations? What are the trends and emerging issues facing organizations in the nonprofit sector?\n\nWeek 2: Questions to be explored this week are: What is leadership at the governance level and how is it different from management?  What is good governance and why does it matter? What is a board of directors?\n\nWeek 3: This week's questions: What roles do board members play in nonprofit organizations? Broadly speaking, what are boards responsible for and how do they go about their work? What are some of the issues that challenge the board's ability to go its work?\n\nWeek 4: At this stage, you are asked to review the course content, submit a written assignment (known lightheartedly as a BEAR (Board Effectiveness Readiness Assessment), and take two multiple choice Readiness Assurance Tests (known similarly as RATs). One RAT will assess knowledge and reading comprehension and the other will test application of knowledge within a practical case.  \n\nWeek 5: We will encourage you to discuss the RATs in the discussion forums and take them again should you wish to change any of your answers based on the information exchanged.",

This definition of supervision states the relationship between the managers and their subordinates. This, however, doesn’t explain the manner in which coaches, instructors and mentors motivate people to take up leadership responsibilities for the first time in his/her life. Newly appointed managers find themselves in a new role of coordinating individual efforts in a team’s cause and that requires quickly adjusting to new roles, responsibilities and relationships. To be considered a successful supervisor, they need to develop their skills in administration, technology and interpersonal behavior. This tutorial is designed to help newly-appointed workplace supervisors get a better understanding of their roles and that of others. It contains information on how to work more effectively with apprentices, subordinates, and trainees. ",

            "long_description": "Predictive analytics has a longstanding tradition in medicine. Developing better prediction models is a critical step in the pursuit of improved health care: we need these tools to guide our decision-making on preventive measures, and individualized treatments. In order to effectively use and develop these models, we must understand them better. In this course, you will learn how to make accurate prediction tools, and how to assess their validity. First, we will discuss the role of predictive analytics for prevention, diagnosis, and effectiveness. Then, we look at key concepts such as study design, sample size and overfitting.\n\nFurthermore, we comprehensively discuss important modelling issues such as missing values, non-linear relations and model selection. The importance of the bias-variance tradeoff and its role in prediction is also addressed. Finally, we look at various way to evaluate a model - through performance measures, and by assessing both internal and external validity. We also discuss how to update a model to a specific setting.\n\nThroughout the course, we illustrate the concepts introduced in the lectures using R. You need not install R on your computer to follow the course: you will be able to access R and all the example datasets within the Coursera environment. We do however make references to further packages that you can use for certain type of analyses – feel free to install and use them on your computer.\n\nFurthermore, each module can also contain practice quiz questions. In these, you will pass regardless of whether you provided a right or wrong answer. You will learn the most by first thinking about the answers themselves and then checking your answers with the correct answers and explanations provided.\n\nThis course is part of a Master's program Population Health Management at Leiden University (currently in development).",

This course addresses issues of power, oppression, and white supremacy.\n\n-The first module identifies the needs of children and the role of the state in child development.  We will explore changes in the family and the resulting debates about how to best support families and child development.  We’ll appraise family leave and child care programs for their role in supporting paid work and in strengthening child development, as well as income support efforts including the child tax credit and proposals for a family allowance.  \n\n-The second module begins with a description of child poverty—both the forces leading to it, and its effects.  This module also describes public support programs and critiques the debates surrounding them.\n\n-The third module focuses on persons living with disabilities, evaluating the  landmark Americans with Disabilities Act.   We will also critique the processes of establishing a disability social insurance program and the public aid programs that make people with disabilities eligible for income support and health support.  \n\n-The final module begins with a report on the aging of the U.S. population.  Building on this, we’ll examine social insurance programs and public aid programs for seniors for their longterm viability, and assess the various reforms that have been proposed to stabilize these programs. \n \nThe course is part of a sequence in social policy that has an HONORS TRACK. This track will prepare the learner for masters-level work in policy, which involves reading the literature, writing concise summaries and probing critiques.   Over the sequence the learner will develop a policy analysis that will create a foundation for professional policy analyst assignments.",

You can use this course to help create your own custom preparation plan. It helps you distinguish what you know from what you don't know. And it helps you develop and practice skills required of practitioners who perform this job.\n\nThe course follows the organization of the Exam Guide outline, presenting highest-level concepts, \"touchstones\", for you to determine whether you feel confident about your knowledge of that area and its dependent concepts, or if you want more study. You also will learn about and have the opportunity to practice key job skills, including cognitive skills such as case analysis, identifying technical watchpoints, and developing proposed solutions. These are job skills that are also exam skills. You will also test your basic abilities with Activity Tracking Challenge Labs. And you will have many sample questions similar to those on the exam, including solutions. The end of the course contains an ungraded practice exam quiz, followed by a graded practice exam quiz that simulates the exam-taking experience.",

I appreciate this work and encourage everyone to take a chance to learn from it.\n\nAs a veteran of over 200 MOOCs I must say it is very well organised and the ebook is a really worthwhile resource not only for this course but as a reference book beyond the course. It is obvious that a lot of work and effort went into producing the MOOC.\n\nGreat and thought-provoking content inside. Nicely-made!!\n\nIt is a creative way to address questions raised by the course.\n\nThis is great stuff!!!\n\nThe course content is well-chosen\n\nExcellent video clips!!!\n\nIt was perfect mix!\n\nRealistic view of success!\n\nI found Dr. Chun to be excellent!\n\nThis course was exactly what I needed!!\n\nA very well balanced course in total!\n\nVery clear, easy to follow and an engaging way of presenting complex matter!\n\nThis is a great course. I'm really grateful that you guys have made it and I found it!\n\nEverything was inspirational and many topics were new learning experience for me!\n\nI loved the fact that it included the lives of successful geniuses who practically demonstrated the practical thinking skills for a successful life.\n\nAs an engineer with limited knowledge of philosophy, I found the course very helpful to get in touch with it and get more interested in it.\n\nWe need more such course on Edx! I will hope to see more courses from Dr Jack Chun! I will also request you to at least run twice this course in a year. This year I audited the course. I hope to do this course with a verified certificate soon in next offering of this course.\n\nThis was a very interesting course that has made me to contemplate aspects of my life that require change for me to be successful, as well as giving me an understanding that the acquisition of material wealth will not necessarily equate to a successful life.\n\nThe learning from this course can be directly applied to the real life. Last night, I was watching a mock interview of an IAS officer (in India IAS is a very prestigious government job) and in the interview, they asked some questions by putting you in the situation. In answering those interview question I felt that the knowledge gained from this course helps a lot. I found an application there to solve those interview questions.\n\nThe part I like the most in the course was the interview question because there were 3 different good responses possible. I agree with the ideas of Kant in general, but I think in some instances, like the interview question, I will follow other philosopher's ideas.\n\nThe mix of ancient and modern gave a well-rounded perspective on practical and philosophical approaches to living a successful life. It was interesting to compare and contrast Aristotle, Kant and Mill with the more modern approaches.\n\nLive video and interviews with people such as Jack Ma or Bruce Lee are the key. The micro-movie dramatization was effective.\n\nI can recall information from the cartoons easier. I enjoy reading thoughts posted by other students.\n\nThe practical examples (i.e. cartoons on Kant, Aristotle and Mill) were very helpful to get across the points of their ideas.\n\n",

We know that the culture of higher education is different from the culture of the military in meaningful ways, and we also know that one of the keys to excelling in college - especially for student veterans - is learning to navigate these differences successfully, right from the very start.<br /><br />This course aims to help you do just that. First, the course will orient you to the norms and expectations of the college classroom. The quicker you know what is expected of you, the quicker you can start learning. Second, the course will offer you strategies to ease your transition, to help you achieve your academic goals, and to allow you to make the most of your college education.<br /><br />While this course is open to everyone, the content has been tailored specifically for student veterans currently pursuing higher education, active duty servicemembers who aspire to start school or return to school soon, and higher education professionals who work to support student veterans at their schools. If this sounds like you, and if you&rsquo;re ready to learn how to make your transition easier and more successful, then we hope you&rsquo;ll join us.<br /><br />This online curriculum may be used in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, as a start-to finish, self-directed online experience (MOOC). It can also, in its current format, serve as an &ldquo;orientation&rdquo; for other student veteran success programs. We also invite you to utilize this resource as a library/toolkit of academic success strategies, a tool for flipped classroom pedagogy, or a companion text for on-the-ground transition courses.<br /><br />We welcome the opportunity to assist higher education institutions (both 2-year and 4-year), military installation education services officers and transition assistance programs, veteran focused non-profit organizations, and more. To get underway, contact us at the Columbia University Center for Veteran Transition and Integration.<",

I appreciate this work and encourage everyone to take a chance to learn from it.\n\nAs a veteran of over 200 MOOCs I must say it is very well organised and the ebook is a really worthwhile resource not only for this course but as a reference book beyond the course. It is obvious that a lot of work and effort went into producing the MOOC.\n\nGreat and thought-provoking content inside. Nicely-made!!\n\nIt is a creative way to address questions raised by the course.\n\nThis is great stuff!!!\n\nThe course content is well-chosen\n\nExcellent video clips!!!\n\nIt was perfect mix!\n\nRealistic view of success!\n\nI found Dr. Chun to be excellent!\n\nThis course was exactly what I needed!!\n\nA very well balanced course in total!\n\nVery clear, easy to follow and an engaging way of presenting complex matter!\n\nThis is a great course. I'm really grateful that you guys have made it and I found it!\n\nEverything was inspirational and many topics were new learning experience for me!\n\nI loved the fact that it included the lives of successful geniuses who practically demonstrated the practical thinking skills for a successful life.\n\nAs an engineer with limited knowledge of philosophy, I found the course very helpful to get in touch with it and get more interested in it.\n\nWe need more such course on Edx! I will hope to see more courses from Dr Jack Chun! I will also request you to at least run twice this course in a year. This year I audited the course. I hope to do this course with a verified certificate soon in next offering of this course.\n\nThis was a very interesting course that has made me to contemplate aspects of my life that require change for me to be successful, as well as giving me an understanding that the acquisition of material wealth will not necessarily equate to a successful life.\n\nThe learning from this course can be directly applied to the real life. Last night, I was watching a mock interview of an IAS officer (in India IAS is a very prestigious government job) and in the interview, they asked some questions by putting you in the situation. In answering those interview question I felt that the knowledge gained from this course helps a lot. I found an application there to solve those interview questions.\n\nThe part I like the most in the course was the interview question because there were 3 different good responses possible. I agree with the ideas of Kant in general, but I think in some instances, like the interview question, I will follow other philosopher's ideas.\n\nThe mix of ancient and modern gave a well-rounded perspective on practical and philosophical approaches to living a successful life. It was interesting to compare and contrast Aristotle, Kant and Mill with the more modern approaches.\n\nLive video and interviews with people such as Jack Ma or Bruce Lee are the key. The micro-movie dramatization was effective.\n\nI can recall information from the cartoons easier. I enjoy reading thoughts posted by other students.\n\nThe practical examples (i.e. cartoons on Kant, Aristotle and Mill) were very helpful to get across the points of their ideas.\n\n",

Throughout the course, working in Python on Linux, you will develop a web application building upon your developer skills and using AWS services and tools.<br /> <br /> Your AWS instructors will guide you through getting started with AWS, creating an account, and installing SDKs. Throughout the course, we will use hands-on exercises to build out a web application. <br /> <br /> You will use both the Amazon EC2 and AWS Lambda compute services, as well as learn about object stores by saving and accessing images and video in Amazon S3. You will use Amazon Rekognition to analyze images and video. Collected data will be managed using the Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS). You will refactor your application along the way, increase availability using load balancing, and improve performance and durability using messaging and queuing with the AWS SNS messaging service and Amazon SQS queuing service.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> Throughout the class, your instructors will introduce you to general AWS concepts such as Regions, Availability Zones, Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs), and Security Groups. You will use the AWS service APIs programmatically via AWS SDKs, the AWS CLI, and the AWS Cloud9 Integrated Development Environment (IDE).&nbsp;<br /> <br /> Class discussions will provide an opportunity for you to interact with fellow students as well as AWS training staff. When you have completed this class, you will be ready to continue on into the second course in this series, which will focus on deploying applications in the cloud.</",

If you are aiming to rise up in the ranks in your health system or looking to pivot your career in the direction of big data and health IT, this course is made for you. You'll hear from experts at Johns Hopkins about their experiences harnessing the power of big data in healthcare, improving EHR adoption, and separating out the hope vs hype when it comes to digital medicine. \n\nWhether you're a nurse, pharmacist, physician, other allied health professional or come from a non-clinical background--you know that Health Informatics skills are in demand. This newly launched 5-course specialization by JohnsHopkins faculty members provides a solid foundation for anyone wanting to become a leader in  one of the hottest fields in healthcare. \n\nAs health informaticians, we need to be very clear in our understanding of the current state (as-is), the future state (to-be) and any unintended consequences that can result from our interventions. Prior to introducing large scale change, we need to assess whether a healthcare organization is truly ready for change. This involves taking into account an organization's current culture and values. Successfully leading change through health informatics also requires strategic planning and careful financial considerations. Proper workflow redesign and a clear change management strategy are of utmost importance when introducing new technologies and in ensuring their successful adoption and proper use. \n\nBy the end of this course, students will become familiar with examples of successful and failed attempts at change in health informatics, and the reasons for each. Students will be armed with tools to help optimize their chances for successfully leading change in their respective organizations. ",

            "long_description": "The skills you learned in the military will go a long way toward helping you succeed in college, but if you&rsquo;re looking for some extra support &ndash; or an academic tune-up &ndash; then you&rsquo;ll find it in this course. We know that the culture of higher education is different from the culture of the military in meaningful ways, and we also know that one of the keys to excelling in college - especially for student veterans - is learning to navigate these differences successfully, right from the very start.<br /><br />This course aims to help you do just that. First, the course will orient you to the norms and expectations of the college classroom. The quicker you know what is expected of you, the quicker you can start learning. Second, the course will offer you strategies to ease your transition, to help you achieve your academic goals, and to allow you to make the most of your college education.<br /><br />While this course is open to everyone, the content has been tailored specifically for student veterans currently pursuing higher education, active duty servicemembers who aspire to start school or return to school soon, and higher education professionals who work to support student veterans at their schools. If this sounds like you, and if you&rsquo;re ready to learn how to make your transition easier and more successful, then we hope you&rsquo;ll join us.<br /><br />This online curriculum may be used in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, as a start-to finish, self-directed online experience (MOOC). It can also, in its current format, serve as an &ldquo;orientation&rdquo; for other student veteran success programs. We also invite you to utilize this resource as a library/toolkit of academic success strategies, a tool for flipped classroom pedagogy, or a companion text for on-the-ground transition courses.<br /><br />We welcome the opportunity to assist higher education institutions (both 2-year and 4-year), military installation education services officers and transition assistance programs, veteran focused non-profit organizations, and more. To get underway, contact us at the Columbia University Center for Veteran Transition and Integration.<",

If you are aiming to rise up in the ranks in your health system or looking to pivot your career in the direction of big data and health IT, this course is made for you. You'll hear from experts at Johns Hopkins about their experiences harnessing the power of big data in healthcare, improving EHR adoption, and separating out the hope vs hype when it comes to digital medicine. \n\nWhether you're a nurse, pharmacist, physician, other allied health professional or come from a non-clinical background--you know that Health Informatics skills are in demand. This newly launched 5-course specialization by JohnsHopkins faculty members provides a solid foundation for anyone wanting to become a leader in  one of the hottest fields in healthcare. \n\nAs health informaticians, we need to be very clear in our understanding of the current state (as-is), the future state (to-be) and any unintended consequences that can result from our interventions. Prior to introducing large scale change, we need to assess whether a healthcare organization is truly ready for change. This involves taking into account an organization's current culture and values. Successfully leading change through health informatics also requires strategic planning and careful financial considerations. Proper workflow redesign and a clear change management strategy are of utmost importance when introducing new technologies and in ensuring their successful adoption and proper use. \n\nBy the end of this course, students will become familiar with examples of successful and failed attempts at change in health informatics, and the reasons for each. Students will be armed with tools to help optimize their chances for successfully leading change in their respective organizations. ",

We know that the culture of higher education is different from the culture of the military in meaningful ways, and we also know that one of the keys to excelling in college - especially for student veterans - is learning to navigate these differences successfully, right from the very start.<br /><br />This course aims to help you do just that. First, the course will orient you to the norms and expectations of the college classroom. The quicker you know what is expected of you, the quicker you can start learning. Second, the course will offer you strategies to ease your transition, to help you achieve your academic goals, and to allow you to make the most of your college education.<br /><br />While this course is open to everyone, the content has been tailored specifically for student veterans currently pursuing higher education, active duty servicemembers who aspire to start school or return to school soon, and higher education professionals who work to support student veterans at their schools. If this sounds like you, and if you&rsquo;re ready to learn how to make your transition easier and more successful, then we hope you&rsquo;ll join us.<br /><br />This online curriculum may be used in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, as a start-to finish, self-directed online experience (MOOC). It can also, in its current format, serve as an &ldquo;orientation&rdquo; for other student veteran success programs. We also invite you to utilize this resource as a library/toolkit of academic success strategies, a tool for flipped classroom pedagogy, or a companion text for on-the-ground transition courses.<br /><br />We welcome the opportunity to assist higher education institutions (both 2-year and 4-year), military installation education services officers and transition assistance programs, veteran focused non-profit organizations, and more.

I appreciate this work and encourage everyone to take a chance to learn from it.\n\nAs a veteran of over 200 MOOCs I must say it is very well organised and the ebook is a really worthwhile resource not only for this course but as a reference book beyond the course. It is obvious that a lot of work and effort went into producing the MOOC.\n\nGreat and thought-provoking content inside. Nicely-made!!\n\nIt is a creative way to address questions raised by the course.\n\nThis is great stuff!!!\n\nThe course content is well-chosen\n\nExcellent video clips!!!\n\nIt was perfect mix!\n\nRealistic view of success!\n\nI found Dr. Chun to be excellent!\n\nThis course was exactly what I needed!!\n\nA very well balanced course in total!\n\nVery clear, easy to follow and an engaging way of presenting complex matter!\n\nThis is a great course. I'm really grateful that you guys have made it and I found it!\n\nEverything was inspirational and many topics were new learning experience for me!\n\nI loved the fact that it included the lives of successful geniuses who practically demonstrated the practical thinking skills for a successful life.\n\nAs an engineer with limited knowledge of philosophy, I found the course very helpful to get in touch with it and get more interested in it.\n\nWe need more such course on Edx! I will hope to see more courses from Dr Jack Chun! I will also request you to at least run twice this course in a year. This year I audited the course. I hope to do this course with a verified certificate soon in next offering of this course.\n\nThis was a very interesting course that has made me to contemplate aspects of my life that require change for me to be successful, as well as giving me an understanding that the acquisition of material wealth will not necessarily equate to a successful life.\n\nThe learning from this course can be directly applied to the real life. Last night, I was watching a mock interview of an IAS officer (in India IAS is a very prestigious government job) and in the interview, they asked some questions by putting you in the situation. In answering those interview question I felt that the knowledge gained from this course helps a lot. I found an application there to solve those interview questions.\n\nThe part I like the most in the course was the interview question because there were 3 different good responses possible. I agree with the ideas of Kant in general, but I think in some instances, like the interview question, I will follow other philosopher's ideas.\n\nThe mix of ancient and modern gave a well-rounded perspective on practical and philosophical approaches to living a successful life. It was interesting to compare and contrast Aristotle, Kant and Mill with the more modern approaches.\n\nLive video and interviews with people such as Jack Ma or Bruce Lee are the key. The micro-movie dramatization was effective.\n\nI can recall information from the cartoons easier. I enjoy reading thoughts posted by other students.\n\nThe practical examples (i.e. cartoons on Kant, Aristotle and Mill) were very helpful to get across the points of their ideas.\n\n",

It can sometimes be challenging to step back and reflect in an environment which is fast paced or when you are required to assimilate large amounts of information. Making sense of or communicating new ideas in an innovative and engaging way, approaching problems from fresh angles, and producing novel solutions are all traits which are highly sought after by employers.\n\nThis course will equip you with a ‘tool-box’, introducing you to a selection of behaviours and techniques that will augment your innate creativity. Some of the tools are suited to use on your own and others work well for a group, enabling you to leverage the power of several minds.  You can pick and choose which of these tools or techniques suit your needs and interests, focusing on some or all of the selected approaches and in the order that fits best for you.\n\nThe practical approach of this course enables you to acquire an essential skill-set for generating ideas, with plenty of:\n- Fun e-tivities and exercises;\n- Practical lectures and tips;\n- Video representations of the techniques in action.\n\nBy the end of this course you should be able to:\n- Pick a type of brainstorming you think will be useful to apply to a challenge\n- Use alphabet brainstorming in tackling a challenge\n- Use grid brainstorming in tackling a challenge\n- Use a morphological chart to synthesise a solution to a challenge\n- Use the TRIZ contradiction matrix to identify recommended inventive principles\n- Apply SCAMPER to a range of challenges\n\nThe greatest innovators aren’t necessarily the people who have the most original idea. Often, they are people- or teams- that have harnessed their creativity to develop a new perspective or more effective way of communicating an idea. You can train your imagination to seize opportunities, break away from routine and habit, and tap into your natural creativity.\n\nJoin this course and our community of practitioners in CREATIVITY!",

For most people and organizations, the actual problem solving phase is still very much a random process usually consisting of brain storming, trial-and-error and guesswork. Using structured and systematic innovation methodology allows for solving difficult problems in a shorter amount of time and with better results. Systematic innovation is a cornerstone for innovation strategies&nbsp;in some large multinational companies. <br /><br />The Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ) has gained a reputation for systematic problem analysis, problem-solving and system forecasting. TRIZ was developed in Russia based on decades of research. However, TRIZ is considered to be underutilized and not very well known internationally, especially within the life science sector. <br /><br />The course targets students, professionals and citizens with interest in innovation and entrepreneurship. Innovation essentials in the life science sector context will be presented, as well as TRIZ methods and principles. The aim of this course is to learn when, and how, to use all the tools in the &ldquo;tool box&rdquo;. Case studies will be shared, reviewed and discussed. <br /><br />Participants who complete and pass the course will be able to use structured and systematic innovation methodology in their projects.

This tutorial is intended for InDesign users of all levels of experience. Beginners will find valuable information on how to set up the right document layout and choosing the best colors. Intermediate users will find information on adjusting transparency, inserting QR codes and working with objects and layers. Advanced users will find handy information on creating eBooks, preflighting and packaging documents, and also transitioning workflows between InDesign and popular software such as Word, Photoshop, and Illustrator.

Agile-подходы бурно развиваются в России не только в разработке программного обеспечения, но также в банках, промышленности и других сферах. Вы сможете понять и применить приведенные в курсе примеры независимо от того, разрабатываете ли вы софт или совсем не связаны с ИТ-индустрией. \n\nОба преподавателя курса имеют уникальный практический опыт. Они были разработчиками, менеджерами проектов, руководителями разработки и т.п. А за последние годы — в роли консультантов и тренеров — они помогли десяткам организаций повысить свою эффективность за счет Agile. Подобный опыт на русском языке до сих пор можно было узнать только на дорогостоящих очных тренингах и конференциях.\n\nКурс включает не только видео и тесты. Наибольшую пользу вы получите, выполняя разнообразные задания: например, создавая свою скрам-доску или анализируя ситуации из вашей работы с точки зрения Agile-принципов.\n\nБольшое внимание в курсе уделяется практическим вопросам типа «Как “продать” Agile руководству и команде?», а также путям вашего профессионального и карьерного роста в гибких организациях.\n\nКурс полезен всем, кто хочет применять Agile и Scrum в своей работе, – от программиста до технического директора. Но максимальный объем знаний и навыков от курса получат тимлиды, менеджеры проектов и другие руководители: для них в курсе предусмотрены дополнительные задания, например, «Устранение пороков вашей команды», «Чек-лист правильного Скрама».",

            "short_description": "Apache Camel is an open source framework that provides rule-based routing and mediation engine. Apache Camel essentially provides an implementation of various EIPs. It makes integration easier by providing connectivity to a very large variety of transports and APIs. For example, you can easily route JMS to JSON, JSON to JMS, HTTP to JMS, FTP to JMS, even HTTP to HTTP, and connectivity to Microservices. You simply need to provide appropriate endpoints at both ends. Camel is extensible and thus in future more endpoints can be added easily to the framework. This tutorial has been prepared for the beginners to help them understand the basic functionality of Apache Camel. ",
