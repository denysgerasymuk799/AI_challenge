            "long_description": "This course has four modules, or foci.  The first is to understand the categories of social welfare—populations, income, earnings, and assets— and some related concepts that play a very large role in shaping policy decisions: unemployment, inflation, and the minimum wage.  The second deals with the central institution of social welfare—the labor market, which largely determines how many resources a person has.  The labor market also establishes hierarchy, both through meritocracy and through categories of privilege.  The third is poverty: the differing ways we define who is poor, and how effective U.S. anti-poverty efforts have been.  The final module looks directly at federal decision making, the political organization of ideas, the structure of U.S. government, and the legislative process that shapes much of our social policy. This course addresses issues of power, oppression, and white supremacy.\n\nThe course is part of a sequence in social policy that has an HONORS TRACK. This track will prepare the learner for masters-level work in policy, which involves reading the literature, writing concise summaries and probing critiques.

The course is focused on practical design-oriented modeling and control of pulse-width modulated switched mode power converters using analytical and simulation tools in time and frequency domains. A design-oriented analysis technique known as the Middlebrook's feedback theorem is introduced and applied to analysis and design of voltage regulators and other feedback circuits. Furthermore, it is shown how circuit averaging and averaged-switch modeling techniques lead to converter averaged models suitable for hand analysis, computer-aided analysis, and simulations of converters. After completion of this course, the student will be able to practice design of high-performance control loops around switched-mode power converters using analytical and simulation techniques. \n\nWe strongly recommend students complete the CU Boulder Power Electronics specialization before enrolling in this course (course numbers provided for students in CU Boulder's MS-EE program):\n \n● Introduction to Power Electronics (ECEA 5700)\n● Converter Circuits (ECEA 5701)\n● Converter Control (ECEA 5702)\n\nAfter completing this course, you will be able to:\n\n● Explain operation and modeling of switched-mode power converters\n● Model open-loop transfer functions and frequency responses\n● Design closed-loop regulated switched-mode power converters\n● Verify operation of switched-mode power converters by simulations\n● Understand the Feedback Theorem principles\n● Apply the Feedback Theorem to practical design examples\n● Derive averaged switch models of and averaged circuit models of power converters\n● Apply averaged-switch modeling techniques to analysis and design and simulations of power converters",
