This newly launched 5-course specialization by JohnsHopkins faculty members provides a solid foundation for anyone wanting to become a leader in  one of the hottest fields in healthcare. \n\nAs health informaticians, we need to be very clear in our understanding of the current state (as-is), the future state (to-be) and any unintended consequences that can result from our interventions. Prior to introducing large scale change, we need to assess whether a healthcare organization is truly ready for change. This involves taking into account an organization's current culture and values. Successfully leading change through health informatics also requires strategic planning and careful financial considerations. Proper workflow redesign and a clear change management strategy are of utmost importance when introducing new technologies and in ensuring their successful adoption and proper use. \n\nBy the end of this course, students will become familiar with examples of successful and failed attempts at change in health informatics, and the reasons for each.

            "long_description": "How can you, as a healthcare professional, identify patients that share the same risk of an adverse event? How do you transform your healthcare practice in such a way that you are not only able to provide proactive care but you are also able to improve the health of populations at risk?\nIn this course you will learn how to apply the panel management approach to tackle these questions in order to change from reactive to proactive care. \n\nYou will learn how to empanel (patient)groups that share the same risk and how you can allocate the appropriate intervention to each panel of patients. From there you will dive into ways to transform current workflows for optimal in-reach and out-reach care both at the cultural and behavioral change level. As a final step you will learn how to evaluate both effectiveness and process based on the triple aim. This will give you insight into what can be improved in the next panel management cycle. \n\nThis course will help you gain an understanding of the panel management approach and enable you to change from reactive to proactive care.\n\n This course is part of the Leiden University Master Programme Population Health Management.
