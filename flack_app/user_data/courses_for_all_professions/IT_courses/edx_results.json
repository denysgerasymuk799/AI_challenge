This shouldn&rsquo;t come as a surprise; people have always&nbsp;related to each other and the world through the telling, listening, and interpreting of stories. <br /><br />But increasingly complex health problems, compounded by social factors and other burdens, make for increasingly complex stories. Healthcare professionals make decisions, including the appropriate use of technology, based on the stories patients share. Yet, storytelling and listening are skills that are often largely omitted from the training of healthcare professionals. <br /><br />Healthcare providers must think more creatively, more like creative writers. In the narrative disaster zone of the emergency department, patients&rsquo; stories often feel like first drafts, and first drafts&mdash;for most of us&mdash;can be raw and messy.<br /><br />Expertise with stories is a low-tech skill that&rsquo;s fundamental to connection, communication, curiosity, and problem-solving. It&rsquo;s a clinical&nbsp;ability with multiple potential benefits, ranging from making us more mindful of our thinking to improving patient engagement. Aptitude with stories can both expand our tolerance for uncertainty and reduce risk.<br /><br />We&rsquo;ll focus on stories - challenging stories, in particular. We&rsquo;ll discuss why healthcare providers must think more creatively, even in a field that prides itself on its grounding in scientific evidence. <br /><br />Making the right diagnosis is critically important, but so is learning how to ask the right questions, developing comfort with uncertainty, and working within constraints. In order to treat patients effectively, we must do everything in our power to ensure that the story we are hearing is the one our patients are trying to tell.</",

We know that the culture of higher education is different from the culture of the military in meaningful ways, and we also know that one of the keys to excelling in college - especially for student veterans - is learning to navigate these differences successfully, right from the very start.<br /><br />This course aims to help you do just that. First, the course will orient you to the norms and expectations of the college classroom. The quicker you know what is expected of you, the quicker you can start learning. Second, the course will offer you strategies to ease your transition, to help you achieve your academic goals, and to allow you to make the most of your college education.<br /><br />While this course is open to everyone, the content has been tailored specifically for student veterans currently pursuing higher education, active duty servicemembers who aspire to start school or return to school soon, and higher education professionals who work to support student veterans at their schools. If this sounds like you, and if you&rsquo;re ready to learn how to make your transition easier and more successful, then we hope you&rsquo;ll join us.<br /><br />This online curriculum may be used in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, as a start-to finish, self-directed online experience (MOOC). It can also, in its current format, serve as an &ldquo;orientation&rdquo; for other student veteran success programs. We also invite you to utilize this resource as a library/toolkit of academic success strategies, a tool for flipped classroom pedagogy, or a companion text for on-the-ground transition courses.<br /><br />We welcome the opportunity to assist higher education institutions (both 2-year and 4-year), military installation education services officers and transition assistance programs, veteran focused non-profit organizations, and more. To get underway, contact us at the Columbia University Center for Veteran Transition and Integration.</",

Part two of this series departs from the Civil War, examining how gender shaped women's work outside the home in the late 19th century and how gender influenced the shape of the labor force.

First, you will explore the history of flight including ballooning and obtain a basic understanding of aircraft and the earth's atmosphere. Topics include stability, navigation, propulsion and the structure of aircraft.&nbsp; Block two examines the principles of aerodynamics. You will learn for instance how the shape of an airfoil or wing impacts the amount of lift generated. Block three covers flight mechanics, including various flight phases, such as descending, climbing or cruise, and the most optimal flying conditions for each phase.</p></",

Companies worldwide invest millions per year on the development of new products and services that will ensure their economic sustainability. However, innovation is a challenging endeavor that requires strategic thinking, customer focus, the right organizational climate, and an effective management approach.<br /><br />Designers, with their specific skills, can take a major part in driving innovation. This is already successfully happening in companies like SAP, Pepsi-Co and Philips, where design professionals play a leading role in steering innovation.<br /><br />Inspired by these cases, this design course is aimed at designers who would like to take a more active role in the innovative efforts of companies, and who want to go beyond executing new product/service design briefs. It suits strategic designers with an interest in acquiring a more senior position in the company or even becoming a Chief Design Officer (CDO). Or designers with ambition to better understand and develop their strategic potential, become sparring partners in crafting briefs, and influence strategic decision-making within their organizations.<br /><br />By using a three-step approach for leading and managing strategic innovation projects, this course will teach you how to harness your existing design practices &ndash; such as envisioning, orchestrating, inspiring, etc. and transform them into powerful innovation drivers. You will learn how to use these practices to impact strategic decision-making, win stakeholders&rsquo; support, and identify relevant KPIs. You will also learn how to adapt your design practices and design-driven way of working to a particular company. Finally, you will practice some design methods to make your impact durable over time.<br /><br />Through a combination of short lectures, given by design and innovation experts, practical exercises, webinar and in",

We face challenges in securing the supply of materials and the impact this has on the planet. Innovative product design can help us find solutions to these challenges. This course will explore new ways of designing products.<br /><br />The design of products is an important aspect of a circular economy. The circular economy approach addresses material supply challenges by keeping materials in use much longer and eventually returning materials for new use. The principle is that waste must be minimized. Products will be designed to last longer. They will be easier to Reuse, Repair, and Remanufacture. The product will eventually be broken down and Recycled. This is <em>Design for R</em> and is the focus of this course.<br /><br />Experts from leading European universities and research organizations will explain the latest strategies in product design. Current design approaches lead to waste, loss of value and loss of resources. You will learn about the innovative ways in which companies are creating value, whilst securing their supply chains, by integrating <em>Design for R</em>.<br /><br />This course is suitable for all learners who have an interest in product design, innovative engineering, new business activity, entrepreneurship, sustainability, circular economy and everyone who thinks that the current way we do things today needs a radical rethink.</",

In this course, we will look at the potential benefits of circular procurement and how recycling technologies and more efficient ways of collecting and recycling critical raw materials (CRMs) can make your business and production more resource resilient.<br /><br />A good number of the materials found in everyday&nbsp;products are now referred to as \"critical\". This means that there is a risk of failure in their supply&nbsp;and that they are also critical in terms of economic importance. <br /><br />Many metals, for instance, are already critical or could become critical in the near future due to their limited availability and the growing demand for products worldwide. Think of the newest electronic products that contain critical metals such as gallium, which is used in integrated circuits; beryllium, used in electronic and telecommunications equipment and permanent magnets and germanium found in infra-red optics.<br /><br />Innovative product design and reusing, recycling and remanufacturing products can help to deal with a raw materials shortage. But this can only provide an integrated solution if we keep CRMs in the loop through smarter CRM management. The starting point is to identify CRMs in products. It is not always clear what materials are in which products. It is, therefore, necessary to keep all metals in the loop for as long as possible.<br /><br />Scarcity in the supply chain can not only damage businesses but also&nbsp;negatively impact economic development and the environment. For this reason, the course will also discuss environmental issues and electric and electronic waste regulations.<br /><br />This course will be of value to a wide range of professionals working in or interested in this field. These include professionals involved in producing products containing CRMs (such as electronics) as well as local or national government officials tasked with organizing&nbsp;waste management and recycling for these products. Students interested in the field of waste management will also find this course helpful for their studies in electronics, industrial design, and industrial ecology.<br /><br /><em>This course has received funding from the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT). The EIT receives support from the European Union&rsquo;s Horizon2020 research and innovation program.</em></",

Un chapitre sera d&eacute;di&eacute; &agrave; la tension de surface et &agrave; la capillarit&eacute;. Nous introduirons ensuite le concept de similitude et l&rsquo;utilisation des nombres adimensionnels. Nous allons alors consid&eacute;rer la statique des fluides &agrave; travers la loi de l'hydrostatique. La dynamique des fluides sera abord&eacute;e en premier lieu par la cin&eacute;matique. Ensuite, nous traiterons des &eacute;quations de bilan avec notamment une application du th&eacute;or&egrave;me de conservation de l&rsquo;&eacute;nergie cin&eacute;tique : le th&eacute;or&egrave;me de Bernoulli. Dans le dernier, nous montrerons que ce th&eacute;or&egrave;me relativement simple permet d&rsquo;expliquer et de calculer des &eacute;coulements tels que ceux observ&eacute;s dans les rivi&egrave;res. Les vid&eacute;os du cours seront enrichies de vid&eacute;os d&rsquo;exp&eacute;riences qui illustreront les concepts cl&eacute;s et par des quiz pour tester votre intuition et vos connaissances.

High quality water, to be provided for drinking and irrigation purposes to the world&rsquo;s ever-growing population, is one Great Challenge in the near future. Explore the links between biology, chemistry and soil science that lead to what people often take for granted:&nbsp; good quality water.<br />&nbsp;<br />This course is an introduction to environmental sciences. &nbsp;Using only basic knowledge from inorganic chemistry and biology, the course will lead you to an exploration of every day issues around the world. We will tackle some basic questions: Why did the &ldquo;dust bowl&rdquo; or the Assouan River dam have so profound an impact on soil fertility?&nbsp; How do we explain the mass poisoning affecting tens of millions of people in SE Asian deltas? Why is nitrate, but not potassium, a pollutant linked to agriculture even through NPK fertilizers are used? Besides plants, are there other photosynthetic organisms? Can we reconstruct water quality from centuries ago although no water samples remain? Are biofuel or coal gasification plants viable energy solutions? Why does deforestation result in loss of fertility in the Amazon basin but not in temperate Europe? What critical water issues will be raised by megacities, which will soon represent 2/3 of the world&rsquo;s population? How has the relationship between humans and water changed over the centuries? <br />&nbsp;<br />The class will consist of lecture videos, which are between 10 and 15 minutes in length. Every week, you will have related quiz questions and exercises. These optional assignments will not be graded and the solution will be provided the week after the assignment is posted. At the end of weeks 4 &amp; 10, there will be a graded MCQ (each counting for 15% of the final grade).

La prima, la pi\u00c3\u00b9 giovane per codificazione scientifica, avvenuta solo nel XIX secolo, \u00c3\u00a8 stata denominata \u00e2\u0080\u009cArcheoastronomia\u00e2\u0080\u009d, ovvero la scienza che studia gli allineamenti astronomici di alcuni particolati edifici del passato e il loro significato. Si registra oggi una crescente importanza di tale disciplina da quando architetti, archeologi e studiosi di astronomia si sono resi conto che l\u00e2\u0080\u0099archeoastronomia fornisce una chiave di lettura spesso nuova e inaspettata della forma e della funzione di molti monumenti del passato. Dopo una parte propedeutica di introduzione alla astronomia, in particolar modo ai modelli geometrici usati per lo studio dei suoi fenomeni connessi alle due discipline oggetto del corso, quali ad esempio il movimento apparente del Sole e delle stelle, vengono affrontati alcuni esempi come casi studio. In particolare il corso propone tre ricerche innovative e inedite sul circolo di pietre megalitico di Callanish in Scozia, sulla chiesa Rupestre di San Nicola di Myra nelle vicinanze della citta pugliese di Mottola e sull\u00e2\u0080\u0099osservatorio astronomico Maya di Cichen Itza, dal 1988 patrimonio dell\u00e2\u0080\u0099umanit\u00c3\u00a0 UNSECO. <br />\n",

Organized into five chapters, this course starts by covering the fundamentals of what control structures are and what they do, then moves on to four common control structures in Python. Conditionals let you modify what your program does based on the values of incoming variables. Loops let you repeat tasks for multiple values or while certain conditions hold true. Functions let you encapsulate complex reasoning into reusable chunks of code. Error handling lets you intelligently recover from anticipated and unanticipated glitches.<br /><br />By the end of this course, you'll be able to write complex programs in Python that perform useful reasoning. For example, you could write a program that calculates your weight on other planets, calculates the standard deviation of a series of numbers, or checks for the validity of an incoming password.<br /><br />Structurally, the course is comprised of several parts. Instruction is delivered via a series of short (2-3 minute) videos. In between those videos, you'll complete both multiple choice questions&nbsp; and coding problems to demonstrate your knowledge of the material that was just covered.</",

You will&nbsp;learn the rules and regulations&nbsp;governing the pricing, marketing, and safety monitoring of approved prescription drugs and the importance of the FDA in regulating key aspects of the pharmaceutical market.<br /><br /><strong>Continuing Medical Education (CME)<br /></strong>Medical professionals who enroll in the verified track and successfully complete Module 2: Drug Development and Approval can earn&nbsp;<em>AMA PRA Category 1 Credit&trade; </em>(2 credits).</",

Ultimately, it equips students with a deeper understanding of the legal implications of technological decisions made by clients.<br /><br />Through a mix of technical instruction and discussion of case studies, this course empowers students to be informed contributors to technology-driven conversations. In addition, it prepares students to formulate technology-informed legal arguments and opinions. Along the way, it equips students with hands-on experience with Python and SQL, languages via which they can mine data for answers themselves.<br /><br />Topics include algorithms, cloud computing, databases, networking, privacy, programming, scalability, security, and more, with a particular emphasis on understanding how the work developers do and the technological solutions they employ may impact clients. Students emerge from this course with first-hand appreciation of how it all works and all the more confident in the factors that should guide their decision-making.<br /><br />Keywords:&nbsp;law firm, computer programming, programming skills, computer programmers, patent attorney, legal practice, legal services, legal education, patent law</",

Throughout the case studies, we will make use of exploratory plots to get a general overview of the shape of the data and the result of the experiment. We start with RNA-seq data analysis covering basic concepts and a first look at FASTQ files. We will also go over quality control of FASTQ files; aligning RNA-seq reads; visualizing alignments and move on to analyzing RNA-seq at the gene-level : counting reads in genes; Exploratory Data Analysis and variance stabilization for counts; count-based differential expression; normalization and batch effects. Finally, we cover RNA-seq at the transcript-level : inferring expression of transcripts (i.e. alternative isoforms); differential exon usage. We will learn the basic steps in analyzing DNA methylation data, including reading the raw data, normalization, and finding regions of differential methylation across multiple samples. The course will end with a brief description of the basic steps for analyzing ChIP-seq datasets, from read alignment, to peak calling, and assessing differential binding patterns across multiple samples.</p>\n",

Using knitr and rmarkdown as basic authoring tools, the concept of reproducible research is developed, and the concept of an executable document is presented. In this framework reports are linked tightly to the underlying data and code, enhancing reproducibility and extensibility of completed analyses. We study out-of-memory approaches to the analysis of very large data resources, using relational databases or HDF5 as \"back ends\" with familiar R interfaces. Multiomic data integration is illustrated using a curated version of The Cancer Genome Atlas. Finally, we explore cloud-resident resources developed for the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (the ENCODE project). These address transcription factor binding, ATAC-seq, and RNA-seq with CRISPR interference.</p>\n",

We&rsquo;ll learn how the Age of Exploration and the economic forces of worldwide trade encouraged scientific progress in navigation; and how Jupiter&rsquo;s moons, lunar eclipses, and clockmakers all played a part in orienting history&rsquo;s navigators.<br /><br />Centuries of progress in navigation have helped put humans on the moon and spacecraft on a comet. This course will explain how we got there, and how that progress enables you to get where you&rsquo;re going today.</",

En effet, la plupart des gens se sentent souvent d&eacute;munis face aux situations conflictuelles. Il en r&eacute;sulte que les conflits s&rsquo;aggravent et le climat de travail se d&eacute;t&eacute;riore. Dans certains cas, les conflits peuvent mener &agrave; des plaintes pour harc&egrave;lement psychologique. Des conflits qui auraient pu &ecirc;tre d&eacute;samorc&eacute;s relativement facilement deviennent des sources de co&ucirc;ts organisationnels &eacute;lev&eacute;s.<br /><br />Lorsque vient le temps d'intervenir pour d&eacute;samorcer une situation conflictuelle, plusieurs questions se posent. Comment cerner le n&oelig;ud du probl&egrave;me? Comment &eacute;viter l'escalade? Comment traiter avec les personnes difficiles? Comment &eacute;viter que la situation se r&eacute;p&egrave;te? &Agrave; cet effet, l'utilisation d'un cadre d'intervention peut s'av&eacute;rer tr&egrave;s utile.<br /><br />&Agrave; partir des plus r&eacute;centes recherches et des meilleures pratiques professionnelles, le cours propose un mod&egrave;le d'analyse et d'intervention pour d&eacute;samorcer les conflits organisationnels. Des strat&eacute;gies concr&egrave;tes sont propos&eacute;es. De plus, &eacute;tudes de cas et exercices pratiques permettent de tester l'application des principes du cours &agrave; des situations conflictuelles. En int&eacute;grant le mod&egrave;le d'intervention et les strat&eacute;gies pr&eacute;sent&eacute;es, les participants au cours seront en mesure de d&eacute;samorcer les conflits avant que ceux-ci ne perturbent le climat de travail.<br /><br />Tout gestionnaire ou futur gestionnaire devrait suivre ce cours.

I appreciate this work and encourage everyone to take a chance to learn from it.\n\nAs a veteran of over 200 MOOCs I must say it is very well organised and the ebook is a really worthwhile resource not only for this course but as a reference book beyond the course. It is obvious that a lot of work and effort went into producing the MOOC.\n\nGreat and thought-provoking content inside. Nicely-made!!\n\nIt is a creative way to address questions raised by the course.\n\nThis is great stuff!!!\n\nThe course content is well-chosen\n\nExcellent video clips!!!\n\nIt was perfect mix!\n\nRealistic view of success!\n\nI found Dr. Chun to be excellent!\n\nThis course was exactly what I needed!!\n\nA very well balanced course in total!\n\nVery clear, easy to follow and an engaging way of presenting complex matter!\n\nThis is a great course. I'm really grateful that you guys have made it and I found it!\n\nEverything was inspirational and many topics were new learning experience for me!\n\nI loved the fact that it included the lives of successful geniuses who practically demonstrated the practical thinking skills for a successful life.\n\nAs an engineer with limited knowledge of philosophy, I found the course very helpful to get in touch with it and get more interested in it.\n\nWe need more such course on Edx! I will hope to see more courses from Dr Jack Chun! I will also request you to at least run twice this course in a year. This year I audited the course. I hope to do this course with a verified certificate soon in next offering of this course.\n\nThis was a very interesting course that has made me to contemplate aspects of my life that require change for me to be successful, as well as giving me an understanding that the acquisition of material wealth will not necessarily equate to a successful life.\n\nThe learning from this course can be directly applied to the real life. Last night, I was watching a mock interview of an IAS officer (in India IAS is a very prestigious government job) and in the interview, they asked some questions by putting you in the situation. In answering those interview question I felt that the knowledge gained from this course helps a lot. I found an application there to solve those interview questions.\n\nThe part I like the most in the course was the interview question because there were 3 different good responses possible. I agree with the ideas of Kant in general, but I think in some instances, like the interview question, I will follow other philosopher's ideas.\n\nThe mix of ancient and modern gave a well-rounded perspective on practical and philosophical approaches to living a successful life. It was interesting to compare and contrast Aristotle, Kant and Mill with the more modern approaches.\n\nLive video and interviews with people such as Jack Ma or Bruce Lee are the key. The micro-movie dramatization was effective.\n\nI can recall information from the cartoons easier. I enjoy reading thoughts posted by other students.\n\nThe practical examples (i.e. cartoons on Kant, Aristotle and Mill) were very helpful to get across the points of their ideas.\n\n",

This course provides an introduction to traditional Chinese ethical thought and focuses on the pervasive contrast in the way Chinese and Westerners think about ethical guidance or guidance concerning what is right and what is wrong, good or bad.

We will also learn how to identify, assess and manage foreign exchange risk as well as the role of derivative instruments in hedging these risks.<br /><br />Thanks to the economic liberalization in several countries over the last few decades, the world has witnessed an exponential increase in the free flow of capital across countries, even more so in emerging economies. This has resulted in a globally interconnected ecosystem of banks and financial markets engaged in foreign exchange transactions that are continuously growing in volume, sophistication and complexity. That, in turn, has attracted a plethora of participants whose explicit intention is to either profit from or hedge against the heightened level of risks in the foreign exchange markets.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />This course will unravel those complexities and help you gain a comprehensive understanding of foreign exchange markets: the underlying theories, the instruments traded, the associated risks such as transaction exposure, operating exposure, translation exposure, etc. and how those risks are addressed/redressed using several techniques including using derivative instruments such as currency options, currency futures and currency swaps. &nbsp;<br /><br /><em>This course is part of IIMBx's Professional Certificate program &lsquo;<a href=\"https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/iimbx-risk-management-in-banking-and-financial-markets\">Risk Management in Banking and Financial Markets</a>&rsquo;.&nbsp;</em></p></",

In the beginning, the concept of a cooperative is explained and how it is different from an investor owned company. We also explain why this form of organization is required for producers in the dairy, agriculture, weaver artisan and other sectors of the economy. <br /><br />We then discuss the basic principles of a cooperative and why they evolved. These principles were enunciated by the International Cooperative Alliance (ICA) of all countries. We provide a brief overview of the success of cooperatives in different countries. We discuss some issues in regulation, and the legal and constitutional issues in India. We also discuss how genuine, member owned FPOs or cooperatives can revitalize agriculture in India which still employs over 50% of the population. There are some basic issues related to finances. These include acquiring the initial capital to set up FPOs or cooperatives that are independent of outside control, whether from the Government or the NGOs. Working capital is another important issue for non-dairy, seasonal crops. Distribution of profits is different from the shareholder companies.<br /><br />There are organizational issues regarding the structure and Governance of cooperatives.<br /><br />The most important aspect of this course is how to set up such cooperatives. The context is set in rural India with small farmers, most of whom have no irrigation and hence are rain dependent. They have little capital to invest either in farming or in any cooperative. The quality of their produce is also highly variable. Market prices and crop yields are erratic and volatile. We explain how an external promoting agency, typically an NGO can go into a new region and set up successful Cooperatives.&nbsp;The roles of the two entities, the NGO and the FPO are clearly defined. We touch upon the full life cycle from inception to a sustainable mature successful cooperative. The two basic principles: member owned and governed cooperatives, and no financial subsidy are used to discuss how to set up independent sustainable cooperatives. We use evidence from successful cooperatives to show how this was done. The business aspect, especially marketing is also discussed.</",

        "long_description": " Wind turbines and solar panels are likely to play a critical role in achieving a low-carbon power sector that helps address climate change and local pollution, resulting from fossil fuel power generation. Because wind and solar power output is weather-dependent, it is variable in nature and somewhat more uncertain than output from conventional fossil fuel generators. It is therefore important to consider how to manage high penetrations of solar and wind so as to maintain electricity system reliability. <br /><br />This introductory course, delivered by Ieading academics from Imperial College London, with technical input and contributions from the National Energy Renewable Lab (Golden, Colorado), will discuss what challenges variable output renewables pose to the achievability of a reliable, stable electricity system, how these challenges can be addressed and at what costs. Its overall objective is to demonstrate that there is already a range of established technologies, policies and operating procedures to achieve a flexible, stable, reliable electricity system with a high penetration of renewables such as wind and solar. <br /><br />The course uses a variety of country and context-specific examples to demonstrate the concepts. Policy makers, regulators, grid operators and investors in renewable electricity will benefit from a solid understanding of these considerations, thereby helping them drive forward the development of a fit-for-purpose clean power system in their own regional context.</",

We need to think critically whenever we consider reasons for or against some claim or action&mdash;something required in all fields of knowledge and all kinds of decision-making. <br /><br />Of course, we all know, to some extent or another, how to think critically&mdash;how to think about reasons for or against some claim. The course is built on the assumption that learning more about what exactly is involved in thinking about reasons leads us to do it better. Thus, in each topic covered, our natural logical instincts serve as a starting point, from which we develop a rigorous, theoretical understanding, which then boosts our critical thinking skills.</",

Can small changes in our daily routine improve our quality of life and prevent or delay the onset of illnesses in advanced age? What can older adults and their carers do to promote healthy ageing?

By looking closely at the different aspects of lifestyle behaviours and their impact on our health as we get older, we can take action and promote healthy habits in ourselves and those we care for. <br /><br />In this course, we will learn how it is never too late to modify our lifestyle and engage in healthy behaviours, and we will address health promotion strategies for older adults. This is important to keep in mind, especially when caring for older adults who may need support in their everyday lives to reduce their risk for chronic and debilitating diseases, such as dementias, cardiovascular diseases and musculoskeletal conditions, and improve the quality of life. <br /><br />One does not need to be a carer for an older person to benefit from this course, the principles of healthy ageing can be applied to you, your family members, your friends, or any person who wants to commit to an active lifestyle.</",

        "long_description": " How can we improve the innovation process without sacrificing creativity? For most people and organizations, the actual problem solving phase is still very much a random process usually consisting of brain storming, trial-and-error and guesswork. Using structured and systematic innovation methodology allows for solving difficult problems in a shorter amount of time and with better results. Systematic innovation is a cornerstone for innovation strategies&nbsp;in some large multinational companies. <br /><br />The Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ) has gained a reputation for systematic problem analysis, problem-solving and system forecasting. TRIZ was developed in Russia based on decades of research. However, TRIZ is considered to be underutilized and not very well known internationally, especially within the life science sector. <br /><br />The course targets students, professionals and citizens with interest in innovation and entrepreneurship. Innovation essentials in the life science sector context will be presented, as well as TRIZ methods and principles. The aim of this course is to learn when, and how, to use all the tools in the &ldquo;tool box&rdquo;. Case studies will be shared, reviewed and discussed. <br /><br />Participants who complete and pass the course will be able to use structured and systematic innovation methodology in their projects. Many may be highly motivated to continue developing their skills in additional courses to gain deeper knowledge and potentially gain certification.<br /><br />This course is offered in collaboration with <a title=\"Research Institutes of Sweden\" href=\"https://www.ri.se/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">RISE</a>, <a title=\"Oxford Academic Health Science\" href=\"https://www.oxfordahsn.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Oxford AHSN</a> and <a title=\"EIT Health\" href=\"https://www.eithealth.eu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">EIT Health</a>.</",

This course, unlike other courses in bioethics, is primarily directed towards students reading biomedicine and not only medical educations leading to a certain profession, like physicians, nurses, physiotherapists etc. The latter students often have ethical codes specific to their profession. Moreover, much of their ethical training is about ethical problems that arise in the relationship between health care professional and patient. This course is directed to the students who have scientific biomedical training as their main focus. Such students often end up in development and research or at biomedical laboratories. However, they encounter ethical questions in their professional lives as well.<br /><br />Here are a few examples of the ethical questions that will be addressed during the course:<br /><br />How should we use animals or humans in biomedical research? For instance, what level of risk for harm is allowed? What are the rights of privacy or autonomy of patients or research subjects?<br /><br />How should we distribute the benefits and burdens of medical interventions locally and globally?<br /><br />What medical tests should healthcare offer? Are the certain tests, for instance genetic tests, that should not be offered at all?<br /><br />Who should get access to genetic information about an in",

When we want to describe the identity of a Catholic school today &ndash; with the aim of enhancing its future identity &ndash; we first look at how the individuals within the school relate to faith.\n\nInstitutional Identity\n\nIn this section, we turn from studying how individuals relate to religious content, to how they see their school relating to the Catholic faith tradition &ndash; that is, we move from personal perspectives regarding religious belief to how those same individuals perceive the identity of the school itself. You will learn how to assess Catholic identity and will be invited to think about how to strengthen it.\n\nProfessional Identity\n\nIn this section, we look at how cultural, moral, and religious diversity are treated in a Catholic school community. Here we will examine how individuals evaluate their current school environment and how they envision their ideal one. A school can respond in many ways to diversity, and to consider what these responses might look like in practice can help to support a Catholic school's future development.\n\nSynthesis\n\nIn the synthesis, we bring all three perspectives together to see the school in its totality. We will take a look at the subpopulations and intercorrelations to have a broad and deep understanding of the identity of the school. The shift to a Recontextualising Catholic Dialogue School will be handled together with a case study.\n\nFrom Individual Identity to School Identity\n\nFinally, the possibility of setting up the School Identity Research in your school will be explained, as well as the analysis of meta-data to see on a more global level (group of schools, longitudinal perspective, diocesan perspective, etc.) how Catholic School Identity is developing.\n\n",

Therefore, to better study and understand our minds their evolutionary origins we need to compare our cognitive features with those of different living primates. This approach is called \"Comparative Cognitive Science (CCS)\". CCS is a unique combination of Psychology and Primatology. CCS tries to give answers to the fundamental questions such as \"what is uniquely human?\", \"where did it come from?\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \"how did we get here?\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and \"where do we go?\" This intensive course focuses on chimpanzees, the closest relatives of humans.</p>\n",

Virtually every day brings news about some &ldquo;miracle food&rdquo; that we should be consuming or some \"poison\" we should be avoiding. One day it's tomatoes to prevent cancer, then flaxseed against heart disease or soybeans for reducing menopause symptoms. At the same time, we are warned about trans fats, genetically modified foods, aspartame or MSG. Dietary supplements may be touted as the key to health or a factor in morbidity. According to some, dairy products are indispensable while others urge us to avoid them. The same goes for meat, wheat and soy; the list goes on.This course will shed light on the molecules that constitute our macro and micronutrients and will attempt to clarify a number of the food issues using tthe best evidence available.&nbsp;</p></",

        "long_description": " <p>This course focuses on the phenomenon of ferromagnetism. Ferromagnetism is a magnetically ordered state of matter in which atomic magnetic moments are parallel to each other, so that the matter has a spontaneous magnetization. Owing to ferromagnetism, some materials (such as iron) can be attracted by magnets or become the permanent magnets themselves. The phenomenon of ferromagnetism plays an important role in modern technologies. It is a physical basis for the creation of a variety of electrical and electronic devices, such as transformers, electromagnets, magnetic storage devices, hard drives, spintronic devices, etc. However, in the absence of external magnetic field ferromagnetism does not occur at any temperature. It occurs only below some critical temperature, which is called the Curie temperature. For different ferromagnetic materials, the Curie temperature has its own value. It should be noted that the phenomenon of ferromagnetism arises due to the exchange interaction, which tends to set the magnetic moments of neighboring atoms or ions parallel to each other. The exchange interaction is a purely quantum effect, which has no analogue in classical physics. In this course we shall try to understand the microscopic origin of ferromagnetism, to learn about its experimental appearing, magnetizing field, magnetic anisotropy, and quantum mechanical effect. We try to build a quantum mechanical theory of ferromagnetism. The course is aimed to graduate students wishing to improve their level in the field of theoretical physics.</p></",
