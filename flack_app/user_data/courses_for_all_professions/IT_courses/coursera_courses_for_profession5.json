        "long_description": "The Tinkering Fundamentals course will offer educators and enthusiasts an opportunity to develop a practice of tinkering and making.  We see tinkering as a serious endeavor—one that is generalizable across content and especially good at interweaving disciplines in a way that leads to complex projects and individualized learning opportunities. Tinkering has recently been introduced into the educational field as a potential driver of creativity, excitement, and innovation in science learning. It is seen by many as an effective means to engage in exploring STEM concepts, practices and phenomena. Tinkering typically blends the high and low tech tools of science along with a strong aesthetic dimension that supports children’s (and adults’) self expression.\n\nNB: This is a hands-on course, so you will need several tools and materials to do weekly activities. You are welcome to purchase only what you don't already have—or even better try to scrounge them from surplus stores! We have put together a list of recommended materials, which you can find here: http://bit.ly/motion-materials\n\nFor over a decade, the Exploratorium has been developing science-rich tinkering activities for both children and adults. We see tinkering as a fun yet serious endeavor—spanning many disciplines and content areas and fostering connections between art, science, and technology. Learners follow their own path to understanding by investigating tools and materials and exploring questions that interest them. This opens up a wide range of possible answers rather than any specific “right” one, particularly for teaching STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) subjects in the classroom. This course centers on activities related to Motion and Mechanisms, which offer a wealth of opportunities for thinking through making.\n\nIn this course, we won’t just show you how we develop tinkering activities; we’ll also delve into why. We’ll focus on three important aspects: activity design around specific materials, facilitation strategies, and environmental organization. We’ll also share some guiding principles and learning indicators we’ve developed that can help you integrate tinkering into your elementary and middle-school science program. Whether you’re new to making or a seasoned tinkerer, we hope this course will help you take the next step!\n\nOUR APPROACH TO TEACHING\n\nThis is a hands-on workshop, not a lecture-based class. Participation is essential! We want everyone to be making and tinkering together: trying things out, asking questions, sharing ideas, and reflecting together as a community. This is a wonderful chance to tinker and learn alongside people from all over the world and from all walks of life, so don’t be shy!\n\nPLEASE NOTE: We have put a great deal of effort towards creating a supportive space that encourages exploration. We’ll give you a few ways to get started; prompt you to share your own observations and experience as learners, designers, and facilitators; and hopefully spark interesting conversations and discoveries along the way. While it’s not a requirement, we encourage you to take this class with a friend or colleague, or meet with other people in your area: having support or doing activities with others will enhance your experience and help you stay engaged.\n\nThis project was funded by generous support from Overdeck Family Foundation and the National Science Foundation.",

Then 'Advanced Valuation and Strategy – M&A, Private Equity, and Venture Capital' by Erasmus University Rotterdam is the right course for you! This course is helpful for executives that need to value complete strategies and for all students interested in corporate finance and strategy. We present the latest tools and show you how to apply them!\n\nWe will revolutionize your way of decision making, by extending static techniques from corporate finance with dynamic methods to quantify strategic thinking. Traditionally, we assess the attractiveness of an investment as a mature business, where future cash flows mainly result from past decisions. But, in an ever-changing world, strategic decisions determine the firm’s long-term success and market value. Yet managers often have to consider these long-term implications using intuition and experience alone, with little guidance from structured, quantitative analysis.\n\nOur treatment goes far beyond the use of standard valuation analysis. We introduce the expanded NPV, which brings together DCF, real options, and game theory. Thinking in terms of options, games, and adaptive strategies may help managers address strategic questions such as: How do you value a leveraged buyout? How can you value a high-tech venture with negative cash flows? When should you invest in new ventures in stages? How can you incorporate rival bidders in the analysis?\n\nThe tools we provide can improve your decisions in business and in daily life.\n\n* Who is this class for?\nWe hope that our course appeals to (graduate) students in finance, economics, and business, as well as to high-ranking professionals and a general audience. This course is particularly interesting for venture capitalists, private equity investors, investment bankers, CEOs, CFOs, and those who aspire these affiliations. We offer this MOOC at 3 levels:\n\n1.Executive Summary: \nThis 1-week module provides critical insights into the principles of corporate valuation and strategy. This is accessible for time-constrained executives and the general audience without any prior knowledge.\n\n2. Student Level:\nThis level involves an understanding of the technical details.  This level requires basic knowledge of concepts in corporate finance, e.g., the time value of money, financial statement analysis, capital structure, and the relation between risk and returns. Learners of this level can skip week 1.\n\n3. Honors Level (honors certificate): \nThis level is challenging, engaging, and compelling to an intellectually rigorous student.",

        "long_description": "Regression Analysis is perhaps the single most important Business Statistics tool used in the industry. Regression is the engine behind a multitude of data analytics applications used for many forms of forecasting and prediction.  \nThis is the fourth course in the specialization, \"Business Statistics and Analysis\". The course  introduces you to the very important tool known as Linear Regression. You will learn to apply various procedures such as dummy variable regressions, transforming variables, and interaction effects. All these are introduced and explained using easy to understand examples in Microsoft Excel.\nThe focus of the course is on understanding and application, rather than detailed mathematical derivations.\nNote: This course uses the ‘Data Analysis’ tool box which is standard with the Windows version of Microsoft Excel. It is also standard with the 2016 or later Mac version of Excel. However, it is not standard with earlier versions of Excel for Mac. \n\n\nWEEK 1\nModule 1: Regression Analysis: An Introduction\nIn this module you will get introduced to the Linear Regression Model. We will build a regression model and estimate it using Excel. We will use the estimated model to infer relationships between various variables and use the model to make predictions. The module also introduces the notion of errors, residuals and R-square in a regression model.\n\nTopics covered include:\n•\tIntroducing the Linear Regression\n•\tBuilding a Regression Model and estimating it using Excel\n•\tMaking inferences using the estimated model\n•\tUsing the Regression model to make predictions\n•\tErrors, Residuals and R-square\n \n\nWEEK 2\nModule 2: Regression Analysis: Hypothesis Testing and Goodness of Fit\nThis module presents different hypothesis tests you could do using the Regression output. These tests are an important part of inference and the module introduces them using Excel based examples. The p-values are introduced along with goodness of fit measures R-square and the adjusted R-square. Towards the end of module we introduce the ‘Dummy variable regression’ which is used to incorporate categorical variables in a regression. \n\nTopics covered include:\n•\tHypothesis testing in a Linear Regression\n•\t‘Goodness of Fit’ measures (R-square, adjusted R-square)\n•\tDummy variable Regression (using Categorical variables in a Regression)\n \n\nWEEK 3\nModule 3: Regression Analysis: Dummy Variables, Multicollinearity\nThis module continues with the application of Dummy variable Regression. You get to understand the interpretation of Regression output in the presence of categorical variables. Examples are worked out to re-inforce various concepts introduced. The module also explains what is Multicollinearity and how to deal with it. \n\nTopics covered include:\n•\tDummy variable Regression (using Categorical variables in a Regression)\n•\tInterpretation of coefficients and p-values in the presence of Dummy variables\n•\tMulticollinearity in Regression Models\n \n\nWEEK 4\nModule 4: Regression Analysis: Various Extensions\nThe module extends your understanding of the Linear Regression, introducing techniques such as mean-centering of variables and building confidence bounds for predictions using the Regression model. A powerful regression extension known as ‘Interaction variables’ is introduced and explained using examples. We also study the transformation of variables in a regression and in that context introduce the log-log and the semi-log regression models. \n\nTopics covered include:\n•\tMean centering of variables in a Regression model\n•\tBuilding confidence bounds for predictions using a Regression model\n•\tInteraction effects in a Regression\n•\tTransformation of variables\n•\tThe log-log and semi-log regression models",

It will also have a lecture case study from startup to success.\n\nIn addition, the course will discuss post-marketing clinical trials or Phase 4 trials. These are conducted after a new drug has been approved by the regulatory agencies and launched. In these studies, the new drug is prescribed in an everyday healthcare environ­ment using a much larger group  of patients.  This enables new treat­ment uses for the new drug to be developed, comparisons with other treatments for the same indication to be made, and determination  of the clinical  effectiveness of the new drug in  a wider variety of  patient types, and  more rare side effects, if any, may be detected .\n\nPre-marketing strategy should be instigated as early as Phase 1 clinical trials to ensure that the market's needs are incorporated into the new drug's overall develop­ment. Later phases when clinical results are presented at international medical conferences the marketing strategy is then refined in  order to develop an awareness amongst the medical community who will be prescribing the new drug. In addition to the marketing strategy, pricing strategy and a tactical plan will be developed. Promotional material, and the sales force will be trained so that when the product is approved they can promote the drug to physician, pharmacist and nurses.  \n\nThis course is intended as part 3 of a series: Drug Discovery (https://www.coursera.org/learn/drug-discovery), Drug Development (https://www.coursera.org/learn/drug-development) and Drug Commercialization.  We would highly recommend that you take the courses in order since it will give you a better understanding on how a drug is discovered in the lab before being tested in clinical trials and then launched in the market place.",

To achieve this goal, this course will rely on a multidisciplinary approach that allow you to see how different disciplines get into a single object, in different perspectives and in often complementary ways. This approach will also allow us to appreciate the complexity of a subject like doping.\n\nDoping in sports is a complex practice whose definition and identification is the result of socially and historically constructed norms.\nThis course offers to shed light on the processes that led to the use and prohibition of doping substances. Performance enhancement or physical transformation are two aspects of doping which are seen as problematic, yet even as we speak companies are making fortunes selling body improvement and other forms of “human enhancement” to us. These apparent contradictions will be analysed to show that beyond sanitary questions, doping raises many social, scientific and legal issues. \nIn efforts to control doping, governments and sports authorities have put into place institutions responsible for defining what falls into the category of doping, but also what prevention, repressions and research methods to put into effect. This course will also explore biological control measures such as the biological passport, key legal dimensions, organisations that produce performance, as well as the sociological dimensions of doping.\n\nBesides the Professors of University of Lausanne, the best experts of doping are involved in this course: experts from an Anti-doping Laboratory (LAD- Lausanne-Switzerland), from the CAS (Court of Arbitration for Sport), from the UEFA (soccer), and from the WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency).\n\nTeaser:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20Q3eR_g7rU\n\nMain Learning Outcomes\n\nAt the end of the course the participants will be able to :\n\n1.\tIdentify the “cultural” dimension of doping,  that is as a historical practice linked to the transformation of social norms,\n2.\tGo from a binary way of thinking - for or against doping - to an understanding of the complexity of this phenomenon which is biological, psychological and sociological, all at the same time,\n3.\tRecognize the institutions, the actors and the practices of the fight against doping,\n4.\tExplain how the social and organisational context influences individuals decisions and how this influence can be reduced by effective prevention measures,\n5.\tIdentify how the fight against doping is led and how testing is carried out.",

I have been studying prostate cancer and treating patients with prostate cancer for over 25 years.\nOver 1,000,000 men worldwide and 230,000 men in the United States are diagnosed with prostate cancer every year. Three hundred thousand men worldwide and 30,000 men in the US are dying from prostate cancer every year. As people live longer, the incidence of prostate cancer is rising worldwide and prostate cancer continues to be a major health problem. Thanks to years of dedication and commitment to research we’ve made enormous advances in the treatment of prostate cancer, But there is still a lot of work to be done. In this Understanding Prostate Cancer course, I will provide an introduction to the biology of prostate cancer as well as how it is identified and treated at various stages of the disease. \n\nI've put together this course in order to introduce you to the essentials of prostate cancer.\n\nBy the time you finish this course you'll be able to\n\tDefine risk factors for prostate cancer\n\tUnderstand current prostate cancer screening guidelines\n\tUnderstand prostate cancer staging\n\tUnderstand treatments for localized prostate cancer\n\tUnderstand treatments for advanced prostate cancer\n\tUnderstand treatments to alleviate the symptoms caused by prostate cancer\n\nThis Understanding Prostate Cancer Course should be helpful to anyone who wants to develop a deeper understanding of prostate cancer biology and treatment.  It should be useful to students who are interested in a deeper understanding of the science of cancer. It should also be helpful to health care providers, data managers, and educators who wish to develop a better understanding of prostate cancer and how it affects individuals.  The course is not designed for patients seeking treatment guidance. For those of you who might be thinking about a career in cancer research or patient care, I hope this course will inspire you to pursue that path! The course is divided into five modules organized to facilitate learning.\n\nI'm glad that you decided to join this course. I hope that you will develop a basic understanding of prostate cancer.

In addition to firms that have failed, we will look at some that have survived and are doing well.  What are their strategies for survival?\n\nBy highlighting the reasons for the decline of firms and industries, participants can begin to understand how to keep the same thing from happening to them.

        "long_description": "The Tinkering Fundamentals course will offer educators and enthusiasts an opportunity to develop a practice of tinkering and making.  We see tinkering as a serious endeavor—one that is generalizable across content and especially good at interweaving disciplines in a way that leads to complex projects and individualized learning opportunities. Tinkering has recently been introduced into the educational field as a potential driver of creativity, excitement, and innovation in science learning. It is seen by many as an effective means to engage in exploring STEM concepts, practices and phenomena. Tinkering typically blends the high and low tech tools of science along with a strong aesthetic dimension that supports children’s (and adults) self expression.\n\nFor over a decade, the Exploratorium has been developing science-rich tinkering activities for both children and adults. We see tinkering as a fun yet serious endeavor—spanning many disciplines and content areas and fostering connections between art, science, and technology. Learners follow their own path to understanding by investigating tools and materials and exploring questions that interest them. This opens up a wide range of possible answers rather than any “right” one, particularly for teaching STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) subjects in the classroom. This course centers on circuit-related activities, which offer a wealth of opportunities for thinking through making.\n\nIn this course, we won’t just show you how we develop tinkering activities; we’ll also delve into why. We’ll focus on three important aspects: activity design around specific materials, facilitation strategies, and environmental organization. We’ll also share some guiding principles and learning indicators we’ve developed that can help you integrate tinkering into your elementary and middle-school science program. Whether you’re new to making or a seasoned tinkerer, we hope this course will help you take the next step!\n\nOUR APPROACH TO TEACHING\n\nThis is a hands-on workshop, not a lecture-based class. Participation is essential! We want everyone to be making and tinkering together: trying things out, asking questions, sharing ideas, and reflecting together as a community. This is a wonderful chance to tinker and learn alongside people from all over the world and from all walks of life, so don’t be shy!\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Although this course will not have active instructor participation, we have put a great deal of effort towards creating a supportive space that encourages exploration. We’ll give you a few ways to get started; prompt you to share your own observations and experience as learners, designers and facilitators; and hopefully spark interesting conversations and discoveries along the way. While it’s not a requirement, we encourage you to take this class with a friend or colleague or meet with other people in your area: having support or doing activities with others will enhance your experience and help you stay engaged.\n\nREQUIRED COURSE MATERIALS\n\nYou will need several tools and materials to do weekly course activities. Pre-bundled materials are available from the Exploratorium store at www.artoftinkering.com. Please obtain all materials as soon as possible, well in advance of when you will need them in the course. Be sure to allow extra time for shipping and, if you are outside the U.S., for customs. In some cases, certain items may require assembly. Please refer to the Resources section to review this course’s activity guides.",

Both subsectors are overseen by the Department of Homeland Security National Protection and Programs Directorate which manages the DHS National Infrastructure Protection Program. SSA responsibility for the aviation subsector is shared between the Transportation Security Administration and Federal Aviation Administration under the auspices of the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Transportation respectively.  The Department of Homeland Security retains sole responsibility as the Sector-Specific Agency for the Internet subsector.  While TSA and FAA have regulatory over the aviation subsector, DHS has no regulatory authority whatsoever over the Internet. In response to Executive Order 13636 issued by President Obama in February 2013, both sets of SSAs recommended continuing with voluntary cybersecurity measures. TSA and FAA reported they were working to implement the Transportation Roadmap across all transportation subsectors, including aviation. DHS reported that it was working with Internet providers to implement the Cyber Assessment Risk Management Approach. Despite some differences, the Transportation Roadmap and CARMA are very similar to the NIST Cybersecrity Framework and ES-C2M2 examined previously.  That is to say, they are predicated on a continuous improvement process that engages the whole organization in identifying and implementing incremental changes to enhance cybersecurity practices based on prevailing standards.

        "long_description": "The Version Control with Git course provides  you with a solid, hands-on foundation for understanding the Git version control system.  Git is open source software originally created by Linus Torvalds. Git manages team files for large and small projects. This allows the team to continuously improve its product. It is used by most major technology companies, and is assumed knowledge for many modern programming and IT jobs.  It is a core component of DevOps, continuous delivery pipelines and cloud-native computing. You could also use Git to manage the many continuously improving revisions of that book that you are writing. \n\nIn this course, you will not learn everything there is to know about Git, but you will build a strong conceptual understanding of the technology, and afterward will be able to confidently dig deeper on any topic that interests you. This course assumes no previous knowledge of Git, but if you do have experience with it, you may find this course to be both useful and challenging. This is especially true if you currently \"know just enough Git to be dangerous\". \n\nThere are two paths in this course. Both rely heavily on hands-on labs. One path assumes that you have experience using a command line interface, and the other path uses the Sourcetree graphical client. If you are not experienced with a command line, we highly suggest that you go through the Sourcetree path. Eventually, you might want to go through both paths, so that you can decide which tool to use for specific tasks. Besides, repetition is good for learning :)\n\nYou can watch the videos and take the quizzes from your phone if you want, but the hands-on labs require you to have a Windows or Mac computer. If you use the command line path through the course, you can also use Linux. \n\nThis course uses Bitbucket (bitbucket.org) as the hosted provider for remote Git repositories. Bitbucket is free for teams of up to 5 people, including private repositories. However, most of the knowledge that you gain in this course applies to Git itself, and you can apply this knowledge to other hosted Git providers (such as GitHub). \n\nThis course tries to be as concise as possible. It will probably take you about 5-10 hours to go through one of the two paths, but your mileage may vary.",

You must learn to overhaul your relationship with failure, which is a valuable source of experience and should be managed according to the logic of “acceptable loss”: the entrepreneur loves uncertainty, not excessive risk. The creation of tech businesses gives you a genuine opportunity to change the world, but requires you to adopt a particular state of mind and to be able to acquire knowledge, know-how and interpersonal skills.\n\nYou will have the chance to work alongside passionate and exciting people from a whole multitude of backgrounds. From a technological point of view, these women and men have constructed numerous companies of a global scale.\n\nThe development trajectory of a tech business is full of mishaps which require you to be both agile and greatly prepared to build on a strong idea, choose your market, develop your proposal, assemble a team worthy of the task in hand, and finding financing.\n\nThe course is made up of methodological sessions as well as first-hand accounts from entrepreneurs and people who have succeeded in creating tech businesses themselves. You will thus be able to get to know the essential dilemmas with which high-tech business creators are confronted with, beginning with the initial decision to set up your very own structure, which itself represents a significant life decision.\n\nYou will also see that the creation of a tech business is much more a collective adventure than an individual one.\n\nIn the English version, all of the reading content, quizzes and assesments will be in English, whilst the videos will have French audio and English subtitles.",

During the course we will provide you with an overview of the main elements or building blocks of a health system based on the World Health Organization’s guidance. You will have the opportunity to explore four main areas of health systems in global health with particular reference to low and middle income countries. The first area focuses on understanding health service organizations, the challenges. Our second module looks at WHO’s six major building blocks or health systems components with particular reference to primary health care and the need for community participation in planning, delivery and assessment of these systems components. in our third module we examine the specific systems component of human resource development and capacity building. The fourth area consists of health policy making and advocacy with stakeholders. This course is geared toward learners who are already involved in managing health and development programs on the ground in low and middle income countries or who are preparing for such a management role.  The main lectures will span a four-week period with approximately 2-4 hours of viewing learning materials per week.  We have one peer graded essay wherein you will use skills in ‘organizational’ diagnosis to better understand a challenge in an organization where you are or have worked. There are also quizzes. We hope you will engage with your fellow learners in discussion forums to learn from each other.",

Current understandings of human history and social theory are based largely on Western experience or on non-Western experience seen through a Western lens. This course offers alternative perspectives derived from Chinese experience over the last three centuries. We present specific case studies of this new scholarship of discovery divided into two stand-alone parts, which means that students can take any part without prior or subsequent attendance of the other part.\n\nPart 1 (this course) focuses on comparative inequality and opportunity and addresses two related questions ‘Who rises to the top?’ and ‘Who gets what?’.\n\nPart 2 (https://www.coursera.org/learn/understanding-china-history-part-2) turns to an arguably even more important question ‘Who are we?’ as seen through the framework of comparative population behavior - mortality, marriage, and reproduction – and their interaction with economic conditions and human values. We do so because mortality and reproduction are fundamental and universal, because they differ historically just as radically between China and the West as patterns of inequality and opportunity, and because these differences demonstrate the mutability of human behavior and values.\n\nCourse Overview video: https://youtu.be/dzUPRyJ4ETk",

The EVs are known to be involved in cell to cell communication. Apart from maintaining normal cell physiology, EVs deliver messages that can drive or influence the progression of a disease. This course discusses recent advances made in the field to give an introduction on their function in health as well as in disease.This course includes four modules. Module 1 is an introduction to the course, and provides an overview of the previous MOOC on EVs “Basics of Extracellular Vesicles”. Module 2 focuses on the role of EVs in physiological conditions and gives various examples on their role in metabolism, inflammation, immunity and pregnancy and coagulation. This module also briefly covers the topic of microorganism-derived EVs such as  vesicles from bacteria and discusses EVs from apoptotic and senescent cells. In Module 3, we focus on the role of EVs in cancer: how EVs can mediate communication between the tumour and its microenvironment, the functional role of immune cell-derived EVs in development of cancer, as well as the role of EVs in cancer cell proliferation, survival, metastasis and drug resistance. In Module 4, the role of EVs in diseases of the cardiovascular, haematopoietic, nervous, respiratory and urinary systems, and infectious diseases will be presented.This course is recommended for intermediate learners or anyone who is interested in the field of extracellular vesicles and their role in a particular disease including scientists, clinicians, or cell and molecular biologists who look to broaden their understanding of the field.",

Each module a different philosopher will talk you through some of the most important questions and issues in their area of expertise. We’ll begin by trying to understand what philosophy is – what are its characteristic aims and methods, and how does it differ from other subjects? Then we’ll spend the rest of the course gaining an introductory overview of several different areas of philosophy. \n\nTopics you’ll learn about will include: \n\nEpistemology, where we’ll consider what our knowledge of the world and ourselves consists in, and how we come to have it;\n\nPhilosophy of science, where we’ll investigate foundational conceptual issues in scientific research and practice;\n\nPhilosophy of Mind, where we’ll ask questions about what it means for something to have a mind, and how minds should be understood and explained;\n\nPolitical Philosophy, where we'll investigate whether we have an obligation to obey the law;\n\nMoral Philosophy, where we’ll attempt to understand the nature of our moral judgements and reactions – whether they aim at some objective moral truth, or are mere personal or cultural preferences, and;\n\nMetaphysics, where we’ll think through some fundamental conceptual questions about free will and the nature of reality.\n\nThe development of this MOOC has been led by the University of Edinburgh's Eidyn research centre.\n\nTo accompany 'Introduction to Philosophy', we are pleased to announce a tie-in book from Routledge entitled 'Philosophy for Everyone'. This course companion to the 'Introduction to Philosophy' course was written by the Edinburgh Philosophy team expressly with the needs of MOOC students in mind.

В нашем курсе мы познакомим слушателей прежде всего с самыми основами предмета. И сделаем мы это в уникальном формате - иллюстрируя вероятностные объекты и методы на примерах решения с их помощью комбинаторных задач. Суть в том, что, конечно, в базовой вероятности много комбинаторики, и это все знают; мы же расскажем не только об этом, но и о том, как, наоборот, вероятностные методы позволяют работать с комбинаторными задачами. Это позволит нам впоследствии выйти на приложения вероятности в теории графов, случайных графов и, наконец, веб-графов и прочих сложных сетей. Также в рамках курса мы оторвемся от чисто комбинаторных интерпретаций и обсудим более общие вероятностные модели. Но интуиция все равно сохранится, и в этой комбинаторной подоплеке уникальность курса.\n\nКурс построен так, что будет по плечу даже тем, кто изучал математику последний раз только в школе. Тем не менее, так как для понимания курса необходимы знания основ комбинаторики, мы рекомендуем пройти наш курс по комбинаторике прежде чем прослушивать данный курс.\n\nВнутри курса также все просто – каждую неделю вас ждут видеолекции и проверочные задания, которые нужно выполнять в срок. В конце – итоговая проверочная работа. Студенты, которые набрали достаточное количество баллов, смогут получить сертификат.",

We also have a final text in the end of the course and a little bit of writing. As Oscar Wilde said, if you cannot write, you cannot think. If you cannot think, others will do thinking for you. So we find writing and reflecting pretty important for our classes. Along the course we provide you with in-class materials: lecture presentations,  articles and additional readings. If you really want to get into the topic, don’t avoid this extra work.\n\nAlthough a substantial part of this course is theory-based, communication theory has a very practical application. Communication is an underlying process which creates and develops relationships, communities, societies. We communicative on a daily basis via a variety of means and channels. In our globalised and increasingly interconnected world, communication skills are essential in both the personal and professional spheres. It is our goal to leave you with a contextualisation and conceptualisation of communicative processes that will poise you to hone your own communicative skills — in other words, to put theory into practice.\n\nDo you have technical problems?

No nível pessoal, negociamos com amigos, família, proprietários do imóvel em que moramos, vendedores de carro, funcionários, entre outros. A negociação também é a chave para o sucesso nos negócios. Nenhuma empresa consegue sobreviver sem contratos lucrativos. Dentro de uma empresa, as habilidades de negociação podem levar a avanços na carreira.\n\nEste curso fornece uma introdução prática e holística às estratégias e habilidades que podem levar a negociações de sucesso na vida pessoal e nas transações de negócios. O curso cobre os quatro principais estágios da negociação: (1) planejamento, (2) negociação, (3) criação do contrato e (4) execução do contrato. \n\nCada estágio analisa as principais questões que você deverá estar preparado para responder em negociações futuras, como:  \n•\tQuais são os principais elementos em uma análise de negociação, incluindo o preço de reserva fixado, a meta de expansão, alternativas para o negócio em questão e a zona de acordo potencial?\n•\tQue diretrizes devem ser seguidas ao confrontar questões de ética?\n•\tQual é a sua fonte de poder nas negociações e como é possível aumentar o seu poder?\n•\tQuais ferramentas psicológicas podem ser usadas durante as negociações e quais armadilhas psicológicas devem ser evitadas?\n•\tQuais são as quatro principais questões de lei contratual que devem estar no checklist de negociação?\n•\tQuais conceitos e ferramentas podem ser usados ao resolver controvérsias?  \n\nDurante o curso, você assistirá a uma série de pequenos vídeos (que vão de 5 a 20 minutos) sobre cada estágio da negociação.  Os vídeos são interativos e incluem questões para testar o seu entendimento sobre estratégias e habilidades de negociação. O curso também inclui vídeos que dramatizam a arbitragem de uma controvérsia na área de construção e a mediação de uma controvérsia de software de robótica. \n\nDependendo do seu planejamento, pode assistir aos vídeos ao longo de algumas semanas ou pode assisti-los todos de uma vez.  Um aluno que assistiu a todos os vídeos de uma vez concluiu que \"É uma série tão boa quanto Breaking Bad\".\n\nApós assistir aos vídeos sobre os quatro principais estágios da negociação, você poderá participar de uma negociação individual que testará as suas qualificações como negociador.  Os vídeos finais do curso verificam a sua negociação e revisam os conceitos e as ferramentas tratados no curso.  Você também receberá feedback sobre o que faz de melhor como negociador e como pode melhorar.\n\nThis is a translated version.

This MOOC is a part of the Erasmus + Project funded by the European Commission. In this MOOC, you will not only learn what the current legal framework is, but also, how it is applied in the road transport sector.\n\nAfter participating in this MOOC, you will be able to: \n\n1. Describe the basics of the process of European integration, in the light of the affirmation of the four fundamental freedoms \nof the EU, European framework on private international law, the posting of workers, social security coordination and social dialogue.\n2. Understand the interplay between Treaty provisions and secondary sources in the relevant fields.\n3. Understand the frictions between the rationales underneath the legal provisions that govern EU social policy and labour law.\n4. Analyse the most relevant case law of the European Court of Justice with an impact on the rights of international road transport workers.\n5. Familiarise with official documents of the EU institutions and with academic and other relevant literature in this field.\n6. Use, where relevant, the implementation of EU rules by Member States.\n7. Solve cases dealing with the implementation of the applicable legal provisions.\n\nWe are offering you knowledge clips, memoranda that contain in-depth legal information on the different key topics, recommended readings and case law. Next to that after each module, you could test your acquired knowledge by taking a multiple choice test. In the end of this course, you will be able to apply everything you have learned in a practical manner by solving our sample guide case that resembles a real life scenario which challenges you to deal with everyday's problems faced in the cross-border road transport by practitioners in the field. \n\nBy participating in this MOOC, you will find answers to the following questions:\n\n1. Which of the four fundamental freedoms is applicable?\n2. Which court has jurisdiction over a labour dispute and which law governs the cross-border employment relation?\n3. How to apply and enforce the rules stemming from the Posting of Workers Directive?  \n4. Which social security system is applicable and which social security institution is competent to levy the social security contributions? \n5. What is the role of social partners in the cross-border road transport?\n\nIn the end it all makes SENSE! So let's go down this road together. Buckle up!",

        "long_description": "Case Studies: Analyzing Sentiment & Loan Default Prediction\n\nIn our case study on analyzing sentiment, you will create models that predict a class (positive/negative sentiment) from input features (text of the reviews, user profile information,...).  In our second case study for this course, loan default prediction, you will tackle financial data, and predict when a loan is likely to be risky or safe for the bank. These tasks are an examples of classification, one of the most widely used areas of machine learning, with a broad array of applications, including ad targeting, spam detection, medical diagnosis and image classification. \n\nIn this course, you will create classifiers that provide state-of-the-art performance on a variety of tasks.  You will become familiar with  the most successful techniques, which are most widely used in practice, including logistic regression, decision trees and boosting.  In addition, you will be able to design and implement the underlying algorithms that can learn these models at scale, using stochastic gradient ascent.  You will implement these technique on real-world, large-scale machine learning tasks.  You will also address significant tasks you will face in real-world applications of ML, including handling missing data and measuring precision and recall to evaluate a classifier.  This course is hands-on, action-packed, and full of visualizations and illustrations of how these techniques will behave on real data.  We've also included optional content in every module, covering advanced topics for those who want to go even deeper! \n\nLearning Objectives: By the end of this course, you will be able to:\n   -Describe the input and output of a classification model.\n   -Tackle both binary and multiclass classification problems.\n   -Implement a logistic regression model for large-scale classification.  \n   -Create a non-linear model using decision trees.\n   -Improve the performance of any model using boosting.\n   -Scale your methods with stochastic gradient ascent.\n   -Describe the underlying decision boundaries.  \n   -Build a classification model to predict sentiment in a product review dataset.  \n   -Analyze financial data to predict loan defaults.\n   -Use techniques for handling missing data.\n   -Evaluate your models using precision-recall metrics.\n   -Implement these techniques in Python (or in the language of your choice, though Python is highly recommended).",

We consider volcanoes, types of eruptions, and typical rocks found there.

In archaeology and anthropology, human skeletal remains can provide unique insights into the past and the present; insights that cannot be gained otherwise.\nThese insights are explored in five main themes spread out over five weeks of learning. First, it is shown how age-at-death, sex and stature can be estimated by the close examination of (archaeological) skeletal remains. In subsequent modules it is shown how human bones can provide information about the diseases and injuries that people suffered from and what they ate. Also, it is shown how the human skeleton provides information about the kinds of activities that people engaged in and about how they migrated and moved around their landscapes. \n\nIn this course, you will examine all aspects of the human skeleton that can provide us with information about these different facets of life. Together we will explore the scientific field that is known as human osteoarchaeology. \n- Human, because it is about us and our ancestors, \n- Osteo, because it is about our bones, \n- Archaeology, because we use this information to better understand the behaviors and events experienced by past people. \n\nDuring the course, you will decipher the clues left behind in the skeletons of past peoples with the methods and techniques that are presented. You may also discover some clues hidden in your own skeleton and what they reveal about the life that you are living. \n\nWant to know more?

Scientific research across the cognitive sciences has raised pressing questions for philosophers. The goal of this course is to introduce you to some of the main areas and topics at the key juncture between philosophy and the cognitive sciences.\nEach week we will introduce you to some of these important questions at the forefront of scientific research. We will explain the science behind each topic in a simple, non-technical way, while also addressing the philosophical and conceptual questions arising from it. Areas you’ll learn about will include:\n\n          Philosophy of psychology, among whose issues we will cover the evolution of the human mind and the nature of consciousness.\n\n           Philosophy of neurosciences, where we’ll consider the nature of human cognition and the relation between mind, machines, and the environment.\n\n\n Learning objectives\n\nGain a fairly well-rounded view on selected areas and topics at the intersection of philosophy and the sciences\n\nUnderstand some key questions, and conceptual problems arising in the cognitive sciences.\n\nDevelop critical skills to evaluate and assess these problems.\n\n\nSuggested Readings\n\nTo accompany 'Philosophy and the Sciences', we are pleased to announce a tie-in book from Routledge entitled 'Philosophy and the Sciences for Everyone'. This course companion to the 'Philosophy and the Sciences' course was written by the Edinburgh Philosophy and the Sciences team expressly with the needs of MOOC students in mind.
