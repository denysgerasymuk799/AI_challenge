Turn your game ideas into game realities and build on an important set of skills in this JavaScript library. Learn how to make and curate interactive experiences and deploy your games to the web!\nWhy Learn Phaser?\nPhaser is the biggest HTML5 game development framework on the market. It has been used for browser games, mobile games, and desktop games. Learn how to use this library to make games for yourself!\nNote on Prerequisites\nPhaser is built in JavaScript and we will be writing JavaScript code throughout the course, so knowledge of JavaScript (especially functions and objects) will be useful. However, the course is as beginner-friendly as possible and can be attempted without any prior JavaScript knowledge. Still, if Phaser concepts and instructions seem a bit murky it might be best to take a few sections of our Introduction to JavaScript course to build conceptual knowledge.\nWhat Will You Build?\nYou’ll build eight games in this course: \n\nColor a Pegasus: a coloring book application with an eye-catching aesthetic!\nCreate an Adventure: a dungeon crawling text-based adventure game about a dungeon with an orc, a knight, a wizard, and you.\nBug Dodger: Avoid the cascading torrent of bugs and try to get a high score!\nBug Invaders: The bugs are descending to earth and it’s up to you to stop them!\nCodey’s Cave Crisis: learn the basics of how to create the quintessential platformer! \nCodey’s Counting Conundrum: Build a multi-scened game that incorporates tweens and animations. \nTundra Terror: Guide Codey through a frozen tundra brought to life through stunning visual effects.\nCodey Jump: Recreate an app classic that has Codey jumping endlessly upward. \n\n ",

            "long_description": "By the end of this course, you’ll be able to manipulate files and processes on your computer’s operating system. You’ll also have learned about regular expressions -- a very powerful tool for processing text files -- and you’ll get practice using the Linux command line on a virtual machine. And, this might feel like a stretch right now, but you’ll also write a program that processes a bunch of errors in an actual log file and then generates a summary file. That’s a super useful skill for IT Specialists to know.\n\nWe’ll kick off by exploring how to execute Python locally, and organize and use code across different Python files. We'll then learn how to read and write different types of files, and use subprocesses and input streams. We'll also dive into Bash scripting and regular expressions -- both very powerful tools for anyone working with systems. We'll even touch on automatic testing, which allow us to automate how we check if our code is correct. To finish, we’ll put all this together by using the tools that we’ve acquired to process data and generate automatic reports.\n\nWe’ll also explain how to set up your own developer environment in your machine. This is a key step in being able to write and deploy powerful automation tools.",

Logistic Regression is an important fundamental concept if you want break into Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Even though popular machine learning frameworks have implementations of logistic regression available, it's still a great idea to learn to implement it on your own to understand the mechanics of optimization algorithm, and the training and validation process.\n\nSince this is a practical, project-based course, you will need to have a theoretical understanding of logistic regression, and gradient descent. We will focus on the practical aspect of implementing logistic regression with gradient descent, but not on the theoretical aspect.\n\nBy the end of this course, you would create and train a logistic model that will be able to predict if a given image is of hand-written digit zero or of hand-written digit one. The model will be able to distinguish between images or 0s and 1s, and it will do that with a very high accuracy. Not only that, your implementation of the logistic model will also be able to solve any generic binary classiﬁcation problem. You will still have to train model instances on speciﬁc datasets of course, but you won’t have to change the implementation and it will be re-usable. The dataset for images of hand written digits comes from the popular MNIST dataset. This data set consists of images for the 10 hand-written digits (from 0 to 9), but since we are implementing logistic regression, and are looking to solve binary classiﬁcation problems - we will work with examples of hand written zeros, and hand written ones and we will ignore examples of rest of the digits.\n\nThis course runs on Coursera's hands-on project platform called Rhyme. On Rhyme, you do projects in a hands-on manner in your browser. You will get instant access to pre-configured cloud desktops containing all of the software and data you need for the project. Everything is already set up directly in your internet browser so you can just focus on learning. For this project, you’ll get instant access to a cloud desktop with Python, Jupyter, and Tensorflow pre-installed.\n\nNotes:\n-  You will be able to access the cloud desktop 5 times. However, you will be able to access instructions videos as many times as you want.\n- This course works best for learners who are based in the North America region. We’re currently working on providing the same experience in other regions.",
